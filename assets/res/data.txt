Methods: A prospective study was conducted on patients undergoing phacoemulsification with IOL implantation. Different IOL models with varying A-constants were compared. Preoperative biometry was performed using optical biometers  and lens power was calculated using advanced formulas  including Barrett Universal II  Haigis  and SRK/T. Postoperative refraction was assessed at 1 week  1 month  and 3 months. Refractive predictability  deviation from target refraction  and percentage of patients achieving emmetropia (±0.5D) were analyzed.  Results: Preliminary data suggest a significant correlation between A-constant accuracy and refractive predictability. The Barrett Universal II formula demonstrated superior results compared to other formulas  with 92% of patients achieving emmetropia (±0.5D) in lenses with optimized A-constants. Variability in A-constants among IOL models was identified as a critical factor influencing refractive outcomes.  Conclusion: Accurate A-constant optimization is essential for achieving postoperative emmetropia. This study highlights the need for standardization in A-constant calibration across IOL models to enhance refractive predictability and patient satisfaction., Non Members, , Dr. Pankaj Soni, parassaran.ps@gmail.com, 8090900250, BRD Medical college , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-01-28 18:13:29]

She was a k/c/o POAG for 2 years  controlled on topical brimonidine and timolol. No h/o ocular trauma  surgery. No known systemic illness. Her BCVA was 6/18 and 6/12 with IOP of 20 and 18 in right and left eye. RE had ciliary congestion  mutton fat KPs  1+ AC cells  normal vitreous  CDR of 0.8 with normal retino-choroid examination.  Left eye was normal with 0.8 CDR. corneal sensations were normal. Diagnosis of RE granulomatous AAU with B/L POAG was made. Patient was shifted from brimonidine to brinzolamide while being investigated. Tests revealed normal blood counts  ESR and CRP. Mantoux  serum ACE  serum calcium  chest Xray  HIV  VDRL were negative. All investigations were negative which led to suspicion of brimonidine associated AAU. At 1 week follow up  the KPs reduced dramatically without steroids with complete resolution of KPs at 3 weeks and no recurrence at 6 months follow up.  Results – Patients on brimonidine can rarely present with acute anterior uveitis which is completely reversible after cessation of drug. Such patients often do well without long term treatment with steroids. Conclusion – Drug induced uveitis is a rare entity  however  treating ophthalmologists should have a high suspicion of it in patients receiving brimonidine for glaucoma. Timely diagnosis and cessation of drug can prevent unwanted investigations and long term steroid treatment. , DOS Members, S-8326, Dr. Ritu Singh, ritusingh.diya@gmail.com, 8858916833, VMMC and safdarjung Hospital  New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-01-31 07:56:42]

Agarwal Trophy Cornea Session , Cornea & Ocular Surface, Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Contact-Lens Assisted CXL and Hypo-Osmolar CXL in Paediatric Keratoconus Patients with Thin Corneas., , Prospective  randomised  comparative  interventional study of forty eyes of paediatric keratoconus patients with thin corneas who underwent modified corneal collagen cross linking and were followed up for a period of 6 months. Forty paediatric patients were divided into two groups  the first group underwent contact lens assisted CXL and the second group underwent hypo-osmolar riboflavin assisted CXL. Only patients less than 18 yrs of age with thinnest corneal pachymetry less than 400 micrometres were included. The primary outcome measures were change in maximum keratometry values on Sirus scan and change in endothelial cell count at 6 months and the secondary outcome measure was change in best spectacle corrected visual acuity at 6 months. The demarcation line in ASOCT was also recorded at 1 month post CXL. KMax values showed a significant decrease at the end of 6 month from 65.56 ± 8.19 diopters pre-operatively to 63.6 ± 8.27 diopters in CL group and from 65.61 ± 14.69 diopters pre-operatively to 63.14 ± 13.69 diopters in the Hypo-osmolar group. Mean ± SD of demarcation line was 198.89 ± 42.42 µm in group CL and 215.4 ± 59.01 µm in group H  with no significant difference between them (p value = 0.333). Both groups showed no significant decrease in specular counts post CXL. Both groups had no significant difference in BSCVA at all the follow up visits.Both contact lens assisted CXL and CXL using hypo-osmolar riboflavin were efficacious and safe in halting the progression of keratoconus in pediatric patients with thin corneas., DOS Members, J-4251, DR.

Study Design- Prospective Interventional Study Method- A prospective interventional study was conducted in patients diagnosed with keratoconus with thinnest corneal pachymetry less than 400 micrometres. 25 eyes of 25 patients who underwent collagen cross linking using individualized fluence (based on Sub400 protocol by Hafezi et al) were followed up for 1 year postoperatively and parameters like Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  maximum keratometry (K max)  thinnest corneal pachymetry and demarcation line (on Anterior Segment OCT) were evaluated. Results- There was mean flattening of 1.51 ± 0.69 dioptre in maximum keratometry with P value <0.01. 85% patients showed either stable topography or improvement over 1 year follow up. The mean depth of demarcation line measured on ASOCT was 255.00 ± 48.30 µm. Conclusion- The management of keratoconus patients with thin corneas remains a challenge and there is paucity of literature on different protocols and techniques especially in the Indian population. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of corneal collagen cross linking with individualized fluence in Indian population and found it to be efficacious in halting progression of ectasia in keratoconus patients with thin corneas.

Methods: A 28-year-old male presented with vision loss in the right eye due to trauma. Examination revealed a large macular hole (1640 ?m) with vitreous hemorrhage. A 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy was performed  and the ILM was peeled and inverted over the macular hole. Due to the large hole size and atrophic edges  autologous blood was injected intraoperatively following fluid-air exchange to enhance closure. The case was completed with silicone oil tamponade.  Results: Postoperative follow-ups showed the macular hole occluded by a blood clot. At one month  optical coherence tomography confirmed anatomical closure. Eight weeks postoperatively  best-corrected visual acuity improved from 1/60 to 6/36. The use of autologous blood facilitated complete macular hole closure by providing a natural scaffold enriched with growth factors.  Conclusion: Autologous blood serves as a reliable adjuvant to inverted ILM flaps  improving anatomical and functional outcomes in large traumatic macular holes. This technique is cost-effective  readily available  and reduces the risk of immune reactions. Further studies are warranted to validate its role in complex macular hole repairs.

Methods: This was a retrospective study done at a Tertiary grade eye hospital in UP  India. Medical records were reviewed from 1/2/23-1/2/24. Treatment given was either intravitreal antibiotics  pars plana vitrectomy or both. Results: Total patients 41. Postoperative endophthalmitis: 72.5% vs endogenous endophthalmitis: 27.5%. Acute cases were 67.5%. The mean BCVA in endogenous endophthalmitis was 1.94 logmar and post treatment the mean BCVA was 0.78 logmar. The mean BCVA in acute postoperative endophthalmitis was 2.34 logmar and post treatment the mean BCVA was 0.98 logmar. The mean BCVA in chronic postoperative endophthalmitis was 2.32 logmar and post treatment the mean BCVA was 0.78 logmar. 37.5% patients were treated with only intravitreal antibiotics (Vancomycin  Ceftazidime and Voriconazole) 47.5% were treated with intravitreal antibiotics with PPV and 15% were primarily treated with PPV.  Conclusion: Endophthalmitis is a grave clinical diagnosis with often a poor prognosis. Treatment varies from intravitreal antibiotics to pars plana vitrectomy. An accurate and aggressive approach at times can help tide away this predicament with surprisingly encouraging results. , DOS Members, SD-1701, Dr. INDRANIL SAHA, INDRANIL124SAHA@YAHOO.CO.IN, 8826239971, , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-02-13 19:32:56]

This case report highlights the diagnostic challenges and management of PSS in a postoperative patient with squamous cell carcinoma. Methods A 46-year-old male presented with progressive  painless blurring of vision in his right eye. Initial examination revealed an IOP of 48 mmHg  fine keratic precipitates (KP)  and an open-angle on gonioscopy. Despite medical therapy  the patient experienced a second episode with an IOP of 66 mmHg postoperatively. Intravenous Mannitol  topical anti-glaucoma medications  and corticosteroids were administered  with close monitoring of IOP and anterior chamber inflammation. Results Following treatment  the patient’s IOP reduced to 32 mmHg within 24 hours and normalized (21 mmHg) at the 15-day follow-up. Visual acuity improved from 6/24 to 6/9. The cornea remained clear  and anterior chamber inflammation resolved with residual KP. Conclusion This case underscores the importance of recognizing PSS in patients with episodic ocular hypertension and mild anterior uveitis. Prompt intervention with IOP-lowering agents and corticosteroids can prevent glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

It can result from direct lens injury  contusive ocular damage  or lens dislocation and is often accompanied by traumatic damage to the cornea  iris  and vitreous  it can lead to significant long term and short term vision loss. The purpose of this study is to analyze the causative factors  management and final visual outcome post surgery based on the different modes of injury.  Methods: Five patients of traumatic cataract came to our side between Novemeber 2024 and February 2025.Of these 2 had blunt trauma  1 had firecracker trauma and 2 had penetrating trauma. This was a single centre  prospective and comparative study to evaluate the final visual outcome based on the mode of trauma and management. Data  included  age   gender   time  of  presentation   type  of  injury  anterior segment  examination    time and   type   of   surgery    visual   outcome   at presentation  and  final  visual  outcome.1 patient underwent catatract extraction with anterior vitrectomy  rest 4 patients under cataract extraction with anterior vitrectomy with iris claw lens implantation in one and pciol implantation in rest three.  Conclusion: Initial uncorrected  visual  acuity at  the  time  of  presentation ranged  from 1/60 to hand movement close to face. Post-operative final visual  outcome  ranged from 6/24 to 6/60.   In  traumatic  cataract  extraction  final  visual  outcome  depends  on  initial  visual outcome    source   and   type   of   injury    duration   of   presentation    type   of   surgery   and complications(if any)., Non Members, , Dr Vinod Kumar Singh, drvinodsingh16@gmail.com, 8174911111, Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, Non Members, , Dr Chandra Prakash, chandan15ax@gmail.com, 9369124599, Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-02-24 23:47:56]

Traumatic Globe Luxation into the Ipsilateral Ethmoid Sinus, , Traumatic displacement of the eye ball into the paranasal sinuses is an exceptionally uncommon sequel of head injury particularly when the  orbit is the site of  major impact. We present a case of a whole globe displacement into the ethmoid sinus following a high-velocity motor vehicle accident  which also resulted in contralateral traumatic optic neuropathy and extensive bilateral orbital fractures. This case is distinct from previous reports due to the combination of globe rupture and luxation  delayed surgical exploration due to ambiguous history of globe fallen out of orbit at the time of trauma  systemic instability and bilateral visual impairment. A review of the literature identified 51 cases of globe displacement  with most involving intact globes and some degree of functional recovery after surgical intervention.

Methods: A 53-year-old immunocompetent male presented with blurred vision in his right eye. Initial examination showed mild inflammation and a retinal lesion  prompting an SD-OCT scan. He was started on oral steroids and IV acyclovir  but noncompliance led to rapid disease progression with worsening vitritis and multiple retinal lesions. Further SD-OCT scans revealed hyper reflective sub-retinal and sub-RPE deposits  raising suspicion for PIOL. MRI ruled out systemic involvement. A vitreous biopsy  obtained via 25G vitrectomy  confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with intravitreal methotrexate and rituximab  leading to significant visual improvement. However  similar lesions later developed in the left eye  requiring further treatment. Results: With intravitreal methotrexate  the patient’s vision improved from 2/60 to 6/6  and SD-OCT scans showed regression of lesions. The left eye was also successfully treated after timely intervention. SD-OCT findings  particularly hyper reflective sub-RPE signals  played a key role in detecting and monitoring PIOL. Conclusion: PIOL can mimic other retinal conditions  making early diagnosis challenging. While biopsy remains the gold standard  serial SD-OCT scans can provide crucial early clues. Multimodal imaging  especially SD-OCT  helps identify characteristic retinal changes  enabling timely treatment and better visual outcomes., Non Members, , Dr Shubhra, shubhra7121996@gmail.com, 8879296682, Pacific Medical College & Hospital  Udaipur, Non Members, , Dr Meet Raninga, meetraninga9@gmail.com, 9427740020, Pacific Medical College & Hospital  Udaipur, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-02-28 12:47:26]

It predominantly affects middle-aged women and poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.  We present a case of a 58-year-old female who reported persistent headaches for 2–3 months. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/12 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination of the left eye revealed posterior synechiae  iris atrophy  ectropion uveae  and corectopia. Gonioscopy showed a closed-angle configuration  and fundus examination revealed a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.6 in the left eye. Non-contact tonometry recorded an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 25 mmHg in the left eye. Specular microscopy demonstrated endothelial cell disarrangement  while anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with ICE syndrome and was started on timolol for IOP reduction.  ICE syndrome frequently presents with progressive angle closure and glaucoma  requiring a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis. Clinical findings  gonioscopy  and specular microscopy aid in diagnosis. While initial management focuses on IOP control with topical medications  refractory cases may necessitate surgical intervention  including glaucoma drainage devices or endothelial keratoplasty in cases of corneal decompensation.  This case highlights the importance of recognizing ICE syndrome in patients with unexplained headaches and asymmetric glaucoma  ensuring timely intervention to preserve vision., DOS Members, , , , , ESI PGIMSR NEW DELHI, DOS Members, KD-2215, Dr. Mehakdeep Kaur, mehakdeep1511@gmail.com, 7087713324, ESI PGIMSR NEW DELHI , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-02-28 19:14:04]

It commonly manifests as painless proptosis  conjunctival involvement  or motility restriction  requiring multimodal imaging for accurate identification.  We report the case of a 55-year-old male who presented with complaints of watering and redness for one month. On slit-lamp examination  bilateral proptosis was noted  with conjunctival chemosis in the left eye. The pupil was round  regular  and reactive in both eyes. Extraocular movements were restricted in superior gaze and adduction  while the fundus examination was normal. MRI revealed an intra- and extraconal mass in the superomedial quadrant of the orbit  highly suggestive of orbital lymphoma.  Orbital lymphoma poses a diagnostic challenge due to its slow progression and varied clinical presentation. While clinical examination may suggest the diagnosis  radiological imaging plays a crucial role in localization and characterization. Histopathological confirmation is essential to determine the subtype and guide treatment. Management strategies include radiotherapy  chemotherapy  or targeted immunotherapy  depending on the extent of systemic involvement.  This case highlights the importance of considering orbital lymphoma in patients presenting with chronic ocular symptoms and proptosis. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are essential for preserving vision and preventing disease progression., DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-02-28 19:53:06]

Methods: This interim analysis included 21 patients with CI-DME who received intravitreal bevacizumab. Retinal sensitivity (MP)  fixation stability (BCEA)  and retinal function (mfERG amplitudes and implicit times in Rings 1 and 2) were assessed. Structural changes were evaluated using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for CMT  and VA was measured using logMAR. Baseline and three-month post-treatment data were analyzed.  Results: MP showed increased retinal sensitivity (25.98 ± 3.01 dB to 27.93 ± 2.59 dB)  with improved fixation stability (0.47 ± 0.09 deg² to 0.40 ± 0.08 deg²). MfERG amplitudes increased in Ring 1 (19.89 ± 2.65 µV to 24.60 ± 2.91 µV) and Ring 2 (15.44 ± 3.57 µV to 16.63 ± 3.73 µV)  while implicit times decreased in Ring 1 (36.32 ± 1.94 ms to 35.43 ± 1.90 ms) and Ring 2 (37.87 ± 2.13 ms to 36.99 ± 2.03 ms). CMT significantly decreased (470.71 ± 37.54 µm to 338.59 ± 41.38 µm)  and VA improved (0.62 logMAR [20/80] to 0.35 logMAR [20/40]).  Conclusions: Intravitreal bevacizumab significantly improved retinal function  with increased MP sensitivity  enhanced mfERG amplitudes  and reduced implicit times. The reduction in CMT and improved VA further confirm its efficacy in treating DME  supporting the role of functional assessments alongside anatomical measurements for monitoring therapeutic outcomes., Non Members, , Tejinder Singh Ahluwalia, ahluwalia_ts@hotmail.com, 8527840077, Nims University Rjasthan  Jaipur, DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-03 09:53:21]

However  the management of subclinical rhegmatogenous retinal detachment remains controversial with differing opinions among clinicians. Here we have aimed to analyze the safety and efficacy of demarcation laser photocoagulation in this subset of patient METHODS: Nearly half of the sub-clinical rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are known to progress into symptomatic detachments  thus  managing them at the asymptomatic stage is recommended over mere observation. Demarcation laser photocoagulation involves creating a laser barrage around the detachment by applying 3-5 rows of confluent laser burns using a laser indirect ophthalmoscopy delivery system. As an outpatient-based  cost-effective  and minimally invasive procedure  demarcation laser photocoagulation can be particularly beneficial for patients who may be unwilling to undergo an invasive procedure in an asymptomatic eye. In this retrospective case series of ten patients  the authors describe the clinical profile and course of patients with subclinical retinal detachment where demarcation laser photocoagulation was employed to manage sub-retinal fluid.  CONCLUSION: In the majority of the patients  a single sitting of laser barrage was sufficient enough to contain the detachment. None of the patients complained of any field defect or vision loss post-laser procedure. This minimalistic approach can prove the best-attempted treatment in patients with good vision and asymptomatic detachments who are not motivated enough for invasive surgery. We recommend closely following the patients so that early progression can be detected. Proper counselling and explaining the warning signs improve patient satisfaction. , DOS Members, , , , , , DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-04 09:45:18]

Occasionally  patients require scleral buckles (SBs) to be removed for various reasons. While outcomes of SB removal have been investigated in this subset of patients  there has not been any large patient series to reach any conclusions. Design We performed a retrospective  observational study to evaluate the clinical indications for  and outcomes of  SB removal.  Methods 15 individuals with a history of SB removal from June 2023 to January 1  2025  were followed up at our tertiary care centre. Exclusion criteria were age of < 18 years and unplanned or self-explanted SB removal. Main Outcome Measures Data extracted included patient symptoms before SB removal  indications for removal  resolution of symptoms following removal  rate of redetachment  and rate of additional ocular surgery.  Results 15 eyes with history of SB removal were included with an average follow-up of 6months. Approximately 60% were males and the mean age at the time of SB removal was 59 years. Leading indications for removal were exposure (61.63%)  infection (20.93%)  and diplopia/strabismus (19.77%). The average time from SB placement to removal was 12.28 ± 11.16 years. Most patients requiring SB removal presented with symptoms  specifically of pain and discomfort (65.12%)  diplopia (22.09%)  and drainage/discharge (18.60%). Of these patients  86.59% experienced symptom resolution following SB removal.  Conclusions Scleral buckle removal provides a high rate of symptomatic relief and low risk of subsequent detachment. , DOS Members, R-5590, DR.

Various intraocular lenses (IOLs) such as anterior chamber IOL  scleral-fixated IOL  and iris-claw IOL (ICIOL) are available. Among these  secondary retropupillary iris claw implantation is increasingly preferred due to reduced complication risks and simplified surgical techniques.  Aim: To assess the safety and efficacy of secondary retropupillary iris claw intraocular lens implantation in aphakic patients.  Methodology: A prospective study was conducted from March 2023 to August 2024 in the Department of Ophthalmology  Chirayu Medical College and Hospital  Bhopal. Aphakic patients meeting specific inclusion criteria underwent retropupillary ICIOL implantation performed by consistent surgical teams. Preoperative assessments included slit lamp examination  corrected visual acuity  intraocular pressure measurement  specular microscopy  optical coherence tomography for central corneal thickness  and detailed fundus examination. Follow-up examinations were conducted on postoperative day 1  and at 1 and 3 months  including the same comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations.  Results: This study aims to evaluate postoperative visual outcomes and identify complications arising from retropupillary ICIOL implantation. Early findings suggest that this procedure offers effective visual rehabilitation with a relatively shorter learning curve for surgeons and fewer intraoperative and postoperative complications compared to traditional methods.  Conclusion: Secondary retropupillary iris claw IOL implantation appears to be a safe and effective surgical approach in aphakic patients lacking sufficient capsular support  enhancing visual acuity and minimizing complication rates. Further detailed analysis during the study period will provide robust evidence regarding its clinical efficacy and safety profile.  , Non Members, , Sukirti Shrivastava, shrivastavasukirti.ss@gmail.com, 9752324402, chirayu medical college and hospital , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-07 12:50:00]

Method: A 45-year-old female presented with a gradually enlarging  painless swelling in the left lower eyelid for 1 year. The lesion was associated with no skin discoloration and showed no fluctuation with the Valsalva maneuver or exercise. No history of similar swellings or systemic findings were noted. Best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes  with normal extraocular movements  intraocular pressure  anterior and posterior segments. The swelling  located near the medial canthus  measured approximately 1.8 × 1 cm  was soft  lobulated  well-circumscribed  mobile  and non-adherent to the skin. Finger insinuation was possible  and no bruit or proptosis was noted. Computed tomography (CT) of the orbit revealed an ill- defined soft tissue nodular thickening of size (9.3 x 1.7 x 12 mm) in the left lower eyelid extending medially till the medial canthus and superiorly till the left globe. The lesion was removed using a transcutaneous approach over the mass by blunt dissection. A red - dark violet well-encapsulated  single lobed mass measuring 0.8 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm was excised. Histopathological examination affirmed the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma with capillary channels lined by endothelial cells and filled with fibrin and RBCs.

METHODS: 2 patients of refractory macular hole were included.  In first patient  autologous internal limiting membrane graft was used to close the macular hole. In second patient  fibrin glue was used to close macular hole. Fibrin glue was nontoxic to retinal tissues as documented by microperimetry.  RESULTS: Both the patients had type 1 closure.  CONCLUSION: The surgical management of refractory FTMH is challenging. There are several strategies that can help  including inverted ILM flap with or without adjuvant blood products  lens capsule flap transplantation  human amniotic membrane and autologous retinal transplantation  fibrin glue. There is ongoing search for the best treatment.

Agarwal Trophy Cornea Session , Cornea & Ocular Surface, Analysis of Inflammatory Cytokines in Tears of Patients With Computer Related Syndrome Dry Eye, , Purpose: To determine the level of inflammatory cytokines/chemokine in tears of computer workers.  Methods: Tear samples were collected from 48 patients who used computers for more than 3 hours per day for at least one year  and from 42 patients who used computers for less than 3 hours per day. Tears were analyzed for interleukins (IL-2  IL-4  IL-5  IL-6  IL-10)  interferon (IFN)-g  tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a  IL-1b  and IL-8. Stripwells 10plex assay kit from Quansys Biosciences  San Diego  CA  USA was used for measurement. The conjunctival impression cytology specimens were examined for IL-1?  IL-6  IL-8  and TNF-? mRNA expression utilizing real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis to verify the origin of cytokines. Results: There was a significant elevation (P<0.001) in concentration of cytokines in the tears of subjects using computers for more than 3h/day (Group 1). Group 1  with an average computer usage duration of 3.8±1.4 years  demonstrated a significant (P<0.05) positive correlation with tear cytokine levels. Conversely  patients in Group 2  with an average computer usage duration of 2.3±1.1 years  exhibited a weak positive correlation. Group 1 exhibited a higher increase in tear film osmolarity and a reduction in goblet cell density. Additionally  there was an inverse relationship between tear cytokines and goblet cell density. Conclusion: Tears from computer users contain increased concentrations of cytokines that correlate with computer use time. Cytokines may play a role in dry eye disease  and cytokine modulators could be considered as a therapeutic approach for computer users with dry eye. , DOS Members, BDT-1891, Dr. RAHUL BHARGAVA, BRAHUL2371@GMAIL.COM, 9999055223, GS MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL, Non Members, , DR.

The goal is to highlight that the dry eye demonstrated in allgrove syndrome could be considered as part of dysfunctional main lacrimal gland and meibomian gland due to defective innervation. Methods-?A 5-year-old male and a 4-year-old male patient with a history of dry eyes since birth and dysphagia. Ophthalmic assessment included Schirmer’s test  tear meniscus measurement  and meibography. Laboratory tests assessed serum cortisol and electrolytes. The diagnosis was confirmed through clinical presentation  ophthalmic findings  and laboratory results. The patients were treated with topical lubrication  glucocorticoids for adrenal insufficiency  and surgical correction of achalasia. Results-?The patients exhibited alacrimia  meibomian gland dysfunction (increased tear osmolarity  meibographic abnormalities  low TBUT )  and low serum cortisol levels  confirming adrenal insufficiency. Management entailed warm compresses to melt thickened oils in the glands  daily lid hygiene to remove debris and bacteria  and topical lubricants (preservative-free artificial tears) to relieve dryness  Conclusion?-Our patients displayed markedly reduced tear production as evidenced by Schirmers test  coupled with elevated tear osmolarity and shortened break-up time. This suggests that meibomian gland dysfunction in our patients is intricately linked to autonomic disturbance. Thus  the dry eye observed in Allgrove syndrome could be attributed to dysfunction in both the main lacrimal gland and meibomian gland due to defective innervation. , DOS Members, BD-1773, Dr. NISHA BHARTI, DRNISHA008@GMAIL.COM, 9013617207, , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-10 13:32:13]

METHOD A conjunctival cyst is a rare yet significant complication following strabismus surgery. This report describes a nine-year-old girl who developed a conjunctival cyst after undergoing right eye medial rectus recession and lateral rectus resection surgery for right eye esotropia. Despite an uneventful surgery and standard postoperative care  she presented with a gradually enlarging subconjunctival mass in the right eye eight months later. Initial conservative treatment with topical antibiotics and steroids proved ineffective. The diagnosis of conjunctival inclusion cyst was confirmed on MRI of orbit.  Patient underwent surgical excision ten months postoperatively. Histopathological examination confirmed the cyst as a conjunctival epithelial inclusion cyst  characterized by cuboidal epithelium containing goblet cells. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful  with no recurrence of the cyst at three months follow-up  stable visual acuity  and maintained strabismus correction  CONCLUSION: conjunctival inclusion cysts may appear after strabismus surgery. Tumor size  cystic nature  and involvement of underlying structures can be determined by radiographic imaging. Early recognition and timely surgical intervention are essential in managing these cysts effectively. This case reinforces the need for ophthalmic surgeons to be vigilant in their surgical practices and to promptly address any complications that may arise postoperatively. , DOS Members, K-2741, DR.

She had no previous history of refractive error and was referred to our hospital for evaluation of anisometropic amblyopia. Upon initial examination  her visual acuity (VA) was 20/200 in the right eye  with -4.50 D in the right eye and +0.5 D in the left eye on auto-refraction. Right eye examination revealed focal congestion with slight pain on extraocular movements  while the rest of the anterior segment was normal. On fundus examination  a large choroidal bulge was noted inferonasal to the disc  which mimicked a choroidal mass. Ultrasonography (B-scan) revealed a chorioretinal bulge (CRT=3.78 mm) with a positive "T" sign. Radiologic imaging did not show any choroidal tumors. Serological tests  including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)  rheumatoid factor  tuberculosis antibody  human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27  TORCH (toxoplasma  rubella  cytomegalovirus  and herpes simplex virus)  HIV  and syphilis antibody tests  were all normal. Based on these findings  the patient was diagnosed with posterior scleritis in the right eye and was started on pulse intravenous methylprednisolone (1 gm per day for 3 days). Following steroid treatment  her visual acuity improved to 20/40 in the right eye with a refractive error of -0.5 D.

Study Design and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 1 236 children aged 1 to 16 years  all diagnosed with myopia through full cycloplegic refraction by an ophthalmologist. Methodology: The study utilized a customized automated retinoscope  created by attaching a smartphone to a streak retinoscope with basic adaptors and hardware. The retinoscopic videos were recorded in both meridians  focusing on the un-dilated pupils of children and were used as inputs for an AI model  trained to screen myopia based on the movement of the retinoscopic beam and retinal reflex in the video. 80% of the data served as training set  while 20% was reserved for validation. The model’s performance was clinically validated using 684 videos from 247 children  with various performance metrics including sensitivity  specificity  accuracy  and predictive values. Results: The model demonstrated remarkable performance with a sensitivity of 96.32% and an accuracy of 96.48% in screening for myopia. These results suggest that this approach holds great potential as a reliable myopia screening tool for children. Conclusion and Significance: The AI-powered digital retinoscope represents a promising  cost-effective  portable  non-professional-dependent solution for early myopia detection  that can be used even with uncooperative children. This innovative screening tool enables quick  efficient  and accessible myopia screening and potentially reducing the global burden of vision impairment caused by myopia. , DOS Members, S-7423, Dr. HARSHA SAXENA, HARSHA24SAXENA@GMAIL.COM, 9893944876, , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-11 10:32:31]

Result: 5 patients with episodic Cluster Headache were included and followed up for 3 years. Between the episodes of the pain i.e.  during the pain-free period  100% of the subjects were asymptomatic  80% with normal orthoptic parameters and 20% with mildly deranged parameters. However  during of the episode of the pain  100% of the subjects developed symptoms with derangement of parameters. The onset of derangement of parameters preceded the actual episode of pain by 20 to 60 days and symptoms were present in only 20% of the subjects. Thus  the occurrence of the episode was predicted in 100% of the patients by regular orthoptic visual assessment.  Clinical implications: Cluster Headache belongs to the group of Trigeminal Autonomic Cephalgias characterised by severe unilateral headache with autonomic symptoms like nasal stuffiness  ptosis  conjunctival injection  lacrimation  rhinorrhoea etc. This study opens ways to predict episodes of Cluster Headaches giving a possibility to start early interventions  prophylaxis to decrease the severity  frequency  duration and morbidity associated with the disease., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-11 11:07:05]

Methods: A retrospective review of seven patients with corneal lacerations was conducted.  The cases included both occupational and non-occupational injuries.  Clinical evaluation  imaging  and surgical management  such as corneal suturing  iris repositioning  vitrectomy  and lensectomy  were assessed.  Postoperative outcomes  including visual acuity and complications  were documented.       Conclusion: The majority of injuries were work-related  with mechanics  carpenters  and farmworkers being at higher risk.  Mechanical trauma was the most common cause  leading to complications such as limbal lacerations  iris prolapse  corneal oedema  and one case of post-traumatic fungal endophthalmitis.  Surgical intervention successfully restored anatomical integrity in all cases.  Postoperative visual acuity ranged from 6/9 to 6/24 in some patients  while others experienced complications like cataracts and corneal scarring  affecting long-term prognosis. Traumatic corneal injuries pose significant visual morbidity  especially in high-risk occupations. While timely surgical intervention restores structural integrity  visual outcomes vary.  Preventive measures such as protective eyewear  public awareness  and improved surgical techniques are essential for reducing the long-term impact of corneal trauma.

Methods  A prospective  hospital-based study was conducted at a tertiary care center  including 60 elderly patients (?60 years old) diagnosed with age-related cataracts. Patients were divided into two groups:  Early Surgery Group (?6 months after diagnosis) – 30 patients  Delayed Surgery Group (>6 months after diagnosis) – 30 patients   The study included 32 males and 28 females  distributed as follows:  Preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  intraoperative complications  and patient-reported satisfaction were analyzed.  Results  Preoperative BCVA: The delayed surgery group had significantly poorer vision  with 63.3% (19/30) having BCVA ? 6/60  compared to 36.6% (11/30) in the early surgery group (p < 0.05).  Postoperative BCVA (at 6 weeks):  In the early surgery group  80% (24/30) achieved BCVA ? 6/9  while only 60% (18/30) in the delayed surgery group achieved similar outcomes (p < 0.05).   Intraoperative complications:  Posterior capsule rupture was more frequent in the delayed group (20% vs. 6.6% in early group).  Dense nuclear cataracts were seen in 46.6% (14/30) of delayed cases  leading to increased phacoemulsification time and complications.   Patient Satisfaction:  93% of early surgery patients reported high satisfaction  whereas only 70% in the delayed group were satisfied due to residual refractive errors and prolonged neuroadaptation.    Conclusion  Delayed cataract surgery in elderly patients leads to poorer preoperative vision  higher complication rates  and suboptimal visual outcomes. Early intervention should be encouraged to improve postoperative recovery and quality of life., Non Members, , Pankaj soni , , , BRD Medical college , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-16 01:27:03]

In perception of light (PL) negative eyes  the focus shifts from vision preservation to pain management. This study evaluates the effectiveness of medical versus surgical management in these cases.  Methods  A retrospective analysis of 30 patients with phacolytic glaucoma in PL-negative eyes was conducted. Patients were divided into:  Group A (Medical Management  n=15): Treated with steroids  cycloplegics  IOP-lowering agents  and analgesics.  Group B (Surgical Management  n=15): Underwent evisceration (n=10) or cyclophotocoagulation (n=5) for pain control.   Pain scores (Visual Analog Scale  VAS)  IOP reduction  and patient satisfaction were assessed at baseline  1 week  and 1 month post-treatment.  Results  Pain relief: 90% of surgically treated patients reported complete relief  compared to 40% in the medical group  where additional opioids were needed.  IOP control: Medical therapy was inadequate in 60% of cases  while cyclophotocoagulation led to a 40% IOP reduction.  Patient satisfaction: 90% in the surgical group reported better outcomes  compared to 45% in the medical group.   Conclusion  Medical therapy provides temporary relief  but surgical intervention—particularly evisceration—ensures definitive pain control in PL-negative phacolytic glaucoma cases. Early intervention and counseling are crucial for improving patient outcomes., Non Members, , Dr. Pankaj Soni , , , BRD Medical college , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-16 01:35:33]

Timely management of traumatic hyphaema is crucial to prevent ocular complications and morbidity. Aim of this study is to determine the visual outcomes and the factors affecting the same in cases of traumatic hyphaema in closed globe injuries.  METHODS-This was a hospital based prospective observational study of 60 patients who presented with traumatic hyphaema following closed globe injuries to a tertiary care centre during the period of February 2023 to August 2024.  RESULTS-. Most of the participants who presented with traumatic hyphaema in closed globe injuries were males and majority of the participants were in the younger age group. 52 % of the study participants presented to the hospital early within 6 hours of injury and only 8% presented after 1 week of injury. Firecracker injury was found to be the most common mode of injury in which self-firecracker injury was found to be the commonest. Domestic accidents were the next frequent cause followed by Sports injuries. Grade 1 hyphaema was the most common. Significant visual improvement was noted at the time of final follow-up compared to initial vision.   CONCLUSION- Time of presentation to the hospital following injury and vision at presentation were found to be significant factors while the mode of injury was found to be marginally significant  and grade of hyphaema was insignificant in deciding the final visual outcome. , DOS Members, S-3828, DR.

While numerous studies have been conducted to compare aspherical versus spherical IOLs  and hydrophobic vs hydrophilic materials  there is a lack of research directly comparing aspherical hydrophobic IOLs with non-aspherical hydrophilic IOLs in a comprehensive manner. By doing a thorough analysis of these two distinct IOL types  this study seeks to bridge the gap in research and offer insights to optimize IOL selection and improve patient outcomes in cataract surgery. Methods: This prospective  randomized study included 72 eyes of 72 patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery at a tertiary hospital in Navi Mumbai. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either an aspherical hydrophobic IOL (HB/AS group  n=36) or a non-aspherical hydrophilic IOL (HL/NAS group  n=36). Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  contrast sensitivity  and posterior capsule opacification (PCO) formation after 6 months of surgery. Conclusion: In conclusion  the study suggests that aspherical hydrophobic intraocular lenses (HB/AS) may offer better visual outcomes  contrast sensitivity  and lower rates of posterior capsular opacification compared to non-aspherical hydrophilic intraocular lenses (HL/NAS) after cataract surgery  particularly at 6 months post-operation., Non Members, , Sumita Karandikar, sumitakarandikar@hotmail.com, 9819389276, DY Patil Hospital  Navi Mumbai, Non Members, , Maheswari Sariki, maheswari.sariki@gmail.com, 9989994050, DY Patil Hospital  Navi Mumbai, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-19 16:08:40]

This study evaluates the visual outcomes and complications associated with secondary SFIOL implantation using the Yamane and X-NIT techniques in aphakic patients.  Methods: This interventional case series included patients with insufficient capsular support due to intraoperative complications during cataract surgery. SFIOL implantation was performed using either the Yamane or X-NIT technique. Postoperative outcomes  including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  surgically induced astigmatism (SIA)  and complications  were analyzed over a short-term follow-up period.  Results: All patients demonstrated significant improvement in visual acuity  with a reduction in mean LogMAR values postoperatively. Astigmatism induced by scleral tunnel construction was noted in both techniques  with minimal SIA observed in the X-NIT group. Reported complications included transient cystoid macular edema  mild corneal edema  and a single case of vitreous hemorrhage  all of which resolved without long-term consequences. No cases of chronic corneal edema  IOL dislocation  or retinal detachment were observed.  Conclusion: SFIOL implantation using the Yamane and X-NIT techniques provides a viable solution for aphakic patients  yielding favorable visual outcomes with minimal complications. The short interval between primary surgery and secondary IOL implantation did not negatively impact visual prognosis. Despite the small sample size and short follow-up  the findings highlight the effectiveness and safety of these techniques in managing aphakia.  , Non Members, G-8501, Dr. Kunjan Patel, drkunjanp@yahoo.com, 9824125485, government medical college Surat , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-19 21:31:33]

In addition to traditional success metrics such as safety  improved vision  and the absence of postoperative complications  factors like quality of life and independence from glasses are now being considered. The ideal intraocular lens (IOL) would deliver flawless vision and smooth accommodation from distance to near without causing aberrations  loss of contrast sensitivity  dysphotopsia  posterior capsular opacification  or diminished functionality over time. Since each lens currently available has its own advantages and drawbacks  utilizing a combination of different IOLs for a single patient may improve outcomes by optimizing vision while minimizing undesirable side effects. Currently  there are three primary categories of IOLs: monofocal  extended depth of focus (EDOF)  and multifocal lenses. We will explore the five possible combinations of these IOLs. Preoperative counseling for patients remains essential. The surgeon must grasp the patients needs and preferences  while the patient should be made aware of the limitations associated with each combination  including potential compromises and side effects. It is also important to inform them about the possibility of requiring enhancement surgeries  along with the related costs and risks. The practice of mixing IOLs has proven to be a successful approach for many patients. The selection of IOLs to be implanted is influenced by the patients lifestyle  preferences  and personality. Until an ideal IOL is created  combining different lens designs will continue to be an effective strategy for vision correction., DOS Members, S-5072, DR.

These injuries are often seen in manual laborers and typically occur during activities like hammering or drilling. Most IOFBs are metallic and tend to lodge in the posterior segment of the eye  leading to mechanical damage  infections  or toxic effects like siderosis  particularly with materials such as iron and copper. The prognosis depends on factors like the foreign bodys size  composition  and location  as well as the presence of complications such as retinal detachment or endophthalmitis.  Method: A 24-year-old male sustained a left-eye injury from a metal foreign body while hammering. On admission  his visual acuity was 3/60  and vitreous haze obscured the fundus. CT and B-scan imaging confirmed the presence of a posterior segment IOFB. The patient underwent vitrectomy  during which the foreign body (3mm x 2mm) was removed using micromagnet forceps after core vitrectomy and posterior vitreous detachment. Endolaser and silicone oil implantation were performed for retinal stability. One month post-surgery  the patient’s visual acuity improved to 6/60.  Conclusion: IOFBs are common in developing countries and usually result from manual labor activities. A detailed history and thorough ocular examination are essential for diagnosing IOFBs  especially since some patients may not experience immediate symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in preventing severe complications  including retinal detachment and permanent vision loss. Timely intervention can significantly improve visual outcomes., Non Members, , Vinod Kumar Singh , , 8174911111, MD Eye hospital  Moti Lal Nehru Medical College  Prayagraj , Non Members, , Anushka Sonkar, , 8299150359, MD Eye hospital  Moti Lal Nehru Medical College  Prayagraj , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-21 21:30:38]

She suffered from chronic cough 1 year back and was started on ATT after HRCT showed lymphadenopathy. She had history of headache and vomiting 2 months back following which CEMRI brain was done which  was suggestive of meningioma. The visual acuity was HMCF in right eye and 6/9 in Left eye. Pupillary reaction  IOP and extraocular movements were normal. Drooping of Right upper lid and mild conjunctival congestion was seen. Anterior segment of right eye had keratic precipitates with posterior synechiae  iris and angle nodules. Fundus examination revealed disc hyperemia and  vitritis in right with normal findings in left eye. This was suggestive of right eye granulomatous panuveitis.  All investigations were normal however Angiotensin converting enzyme levels were highly raised  Based on the findings a diagnosis of Sarcoidosis was made. She was started on oral steroids and topical cycloplegics and steroids. After 3 weeks of regular follow up there was a marked improvement in vision to 6/9 in Right eye with resolution of anterior segment findings and vitritis  CONCLUSION:  This case shows the importance of keeping sarcoidosis as one of the major differential in granulomatous uveitis. In this case pseudo-meningioma was an uncommon but often misdiagnosed finding.. The wide variety of clinical presentation makes it challenging to diagnose often requiring multidisciplinary approach for effective treatment    , Non Members, , Dr Kavin Bhogar, kavinvmmc@gmail.com, 8448834533, ABVIMS and Dr RML hospital, DOS Members, S-1279NS, Dr. DEEPA SHARMA, deepareet@yahoo.co.in, 9968050005, , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-21 21:57:26]

To study postoperative changes in angle configuration after pediatric cataract surgery using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT). Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted  enrolling 20 eyes of children aged 6 to 18 years with visually significant congenital or developmental cataracts  along with 20 eyes of age-matched phakic healthy controls. Children with Pediatric cataract underwent cataract surgery  and AS-OCT was done pre-operatively and post-operatively at 1 month and 3 months after surgery. The angle parameters that were evaluated in this study were Angle Opening Distance (AOD)  Trabecular Iris Angle (TIA)  Angle Recess Area (ARA)  Trabecular Iris Surface Area (TISA)  Anterior Chamber Depth (ACD) and Central Corneal Thickness (CCT).  Conclusion: AOD was significantly greater in the control group (0.77 ± 0.27 mm) than in pediatric cataract group (0.53 ± 0.16 mm  p = 0.002). Postoperatively  AOD increased to 0.60 ± 0.15 mm at 1 month (p = 0.011) and 0.67 ± 0.17 mm at 3 months (p = 0.004). TISA and ARA were higher in controls (0.29 ± 0.12 mm²) than in cataract group (0.19 ± 0.06 mm²  0.19 ± 0.07 mm²). TIA showed no significant difference but increased from 50.86° ± 9.96° to 56.95° ± 10.34° at 3 months (p = 0.018). No significant change in TISA after surgery. ACD increased significantly  (p = 0.014) postoperatively. ARA and CCT remained unchanged postoperatively.

All ports were sutured in all cases. 10-0 vicryl in group A and 10-0 nylon in group B. They were followed up for 3 months postoperatively. Parameters like time taken for suturing  wound apposition  suture related complications e.g.  loose suture  vascularisation  suture infiltrate  mucus collection and need for suture removal and post operative astigmatism were evaluated. •	Conclusion-There was statistically significant difference in incidence of suture removal  loose suture  vasculrisation and suture infiltrate in Nylon group compared to Vicryl group. The astigmatism induced by Vicryl suture and nylon suture was comparable at postoperative 6 weeks. On the other hand  at 3 months  astigmatism was higher in the Nylon group as compared to the Vicryl group. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. There was no requirement of re-suturing for wound leak in any of our cases.  Vicryl sutures may be the preferred option for pediatric cataract surgeries. However  nylon sutures may still be used in elder children who can cooperate for suture removal under topical anaesthesia. , DOS Members, R-277, Dr. ANJU RASTOGI, dranjurastogi@yahoo.co.in, 9818340924, , DOS Members, D-1282, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Glaucoma, Hypotony To Healing: The Power Of Gonioscopy , , Objective Gonioscopy is crucial for diagnosing and managing post-traumatic hypotony due to cyclodialysis cleft  preventing vision-threatening complications. Methods A 20-year-old male presented with left eye vision loss persisting for four months post-RTA. Examination revealed BCVA of 1/60  traumatic mydriasis  a clear but subluxated lens  and hypotony (5 mmHg) with hypotonous maculopathy. Gonioscopy identified an abnormal greyish-white area posterior to scleral spur in superior quadrant suggestive of a cyclodialysis cleft  validated via ASOCT. Atropinization yielded no improvement  necessitating surgical intervention. As the patient was phakic  external cyclopexy was performed. Intraoperative gonioscopy with OVD injection in anterior chamber delineated the cleft extent and depth  full thickness scleral flap was created with 2 mm margins  detached fibrous ciliary body band was sutured to sclera at 1mm with multiple 10-0 Nylon mattress sutures. Closure was verified by the absence of Trypan blue leak after injecting dye in AC. The scleral flap was meticulously secured with 8-0 Nylon to prevent post-operative wound dehiscence and uveal prolapse that may result from post op IOP elevation. Results Postoperative gonioscopy and ASOCT confirmed cleft closure. At two months  BCVA improved to 6/60  IOP was 12 mmHg (1 AGM initiated for IOP rise to 24 mmHg at two weeks)  with resolution of ILM folds. Conclusion This case underscores indirect gonioscopy’s pivotal role in diagnosing cyclodialysis clefts. Early intervention is critical in preventing irreversible vision loss  and proficiency in direct gonioscopy enhances surgical precision and outcomes. , DOS Members, JD-1732, Dr. ANNU JOON, ANNUJOON@GMAIL.COM, 7011255026, Maulana Azad Medical college, DOS Members, N-7935, Dr. Kriti Nausaran, kriti2396@gmail.com, 9582617580, Maulana Azad Medical college, DOS Members, S-335, DR.

Ophthalmomyiasis refers to the infestation of the eye by fly larvae. It can be of 3 types-ophthalmomyiasis externa  interna and orbital.  Case Here  we report a case of ophthalmomyiasis externa in a 21 year old healthy male  presenting with history of foreign body sensation and watering(OD) of 3 days following entry of dust particles  while riding the bike .On slit lamp aided examination  a wandering microbe with rapid  vermiform movements  in upper conjunctival  fornix was seen . Further exploration was done under surgical microscope under topical anaesthesia  two 1x2mm sized   white with speckled pigmented wriggling microbes were removed  and sent to microbiology  for identification. Examination of fundus and other anterior segment structures did not reveal any intra ocular infestation.  Microbiology report identified the organism as Oestrus ovis.  Patient was started on topical Povidone Iodine 5%  ofloxacin eye drop  oral Ivermectin with adjuvant treatment for 2 weeks. Patient was symptomatically better with VA 20/20. He was kept on FU which was uneventful.   CONCLUSION This rare case of ophthalmomyiasis externa with minimal symptoms in a healthy male highlights the importance of careful history taking  slit lamp aided examination and microbiological diagnosis at all level.

The child presented with bilateral corneal opacity.  There was no such history in the family. Ocular examination of anterior segment was normal. Distant direct ophthalmoscopy was within normal limits. The patient had dysmorphic facial features and on 2D echocardiography patient was diagnosed with acyanotic congenital heart disease. Probable diagnosis was peters plus anomaly in left eye more than right eye. Full thickness penetrating keratoplasty is the current standard indication for peters in infants. Combined surgery(cataract extraction and penetrating keratoplasty) can be done for opacified lens and cornea lens adhesion. Regular intraocular pressure monitoring is essential as glaucoma is an association with peters anomaly. Corneal opacification leads to decreased vision early in life which can cause amblyopia. Diagnosis can be done by genetic testing., Non Members, , Dr Vibha Singh, chandan15ax@gmail.com, 7309100586, Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-23 23:14:04]

It highlights a severe complication typically arising from untreated corneal ulcers  trauma  or infectious keratitis  where the structural integrity of the cornea is compromised  resulting in perforation. The prolapse of the iris into the perforated site represents a natural attempt to seal the defect and preserve intraocular pressure and anatomy. Methods: A high-resolution close-up photograph was taken under bright  focused illumination to clearly visualize the anterior segment of the eye. The patient’s upper eyelid is retracted to fully expose the cornea. The image reveals a dense   white-blue corneal opacity indicative of scarring or inflammation. At the center of this opacity  a dark protrusion  consistent with iris tissue  is visible  plugging the site of corneal perforation. Surrounding conjunctival injection and the presence of fine vessels over the cornea suggest neovascularization and chronic inflammation.This clinical photograph did not involve the use of contrast dyes or specialized imaging equipment  relying solely on visual assessment. Conclusion: The image demonstrates a sight-threatening ocular emergency. Corneal perforation with iris plugging can result in permanent vision loss  infection  or structural damage if not promptly managed. Urgent ophthalmic evaluation and likely surgical intervention  such as therapeutic keratoplasty  are needed to restore ocular integrity. This case underscores the critical need for early detection and treatment of corneal diseases to prevent such severe outcomes. , DOS Members, , DR JYOTI DESWAL , jyoti_deswal@yahoo.co.in, +91 94168 57905, PGIMS  ROHTAK , DOS Members, , DR RS CHAUHAN, drrschauhan@yahoon.co.in, +91 94169 22950, PGIMS  ROHTAK , DOS Members, , DR ASHOK RATHI, dr.ashokrathi@yahoo.com, +91 94162 32033, PGIMS  ROHTAK , Non Members, , DR RASHMI BHARTI , rashmibharti1825@gmail.com, +91 73718 59533, PGIMS  ROHTAK , 2025-03-24 03:01:30]

Medical college and hospital  Israna, , E-Poster, Cataract, Shimmering Clue: Cerulean Cataract in a Young Adult , , Objective: To highlight a rare case of cerulean cataract in a young adult presenting with persistent bilateral epiphora and discuss its diagnostic challenges and management approach.  Background: Cerulean cataract  or blue dot cataract  is a rare congenital lens opacity often discovered incidentally during routine eye exams. Although typically benign and non-progressive  thorough evaluation is essential to distinguish it from other ocular conditions and address patient symptoms effectively.  Case Presentation: A 29-year-old female presented with persistent bilateral eye watering for two months. Her ocular history was unremarkable  and initial assessments pointed toward a lacrimal system issue. However  a detailed slit-lamp examination revealed a rare lens abnormality  leading to a diagnosis of bilateral cerulean cataracts. Tear film and lacrimal tests were normal  confirming that her primary complaint was unrelated to the cataract. Management included lubricating eye drops for symptom relief and lifestyle advice  with regular follow-ups to monitor ocular health.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of comprehensive eye examinations in uncovering incidental findings  even when primary complaints suggest a different cause. Early diagnosis  patient education  and regular monitoring are key to ensuring long-term visual health.

We report a rare case of a 12-year-old female with an embedded metallic foreign body (screw) in the upper palpebral conjunctiva for eight years without associated pain or significant symptoms. Examination revealed a deeply embedded metallic screw in the upper palpebral conjunctiva.  This case highlights the inert nature of metallic foreign bodies in specific ocular environments and the importance of thorough ophthalmic examination in cases of persistent eyelid swelling. Successful extraction required blunt dissection. This report underscores the necessity of considering unusual foreign bodies in chronic ocular presentations.The foreign body was deeply embedded and required blunt dissection for safe removal. After administration of local anesthesia  a small incision was made over the conjunctiva  and blunt dissection was used to extract the screw. The procedure was completed without complications  and no residual foreign material was noted.This case is unique due to the prolonged retention of a metallic foreign body in the upper palpebral conjunctiva without significant local or systemic reactions. Metallic foreign bodies  particularly iron are typically associated with siderosis bulbi due to iron deposition in the ocular tissues  or inflammatory responses. However  the inert nature of the screw in this case suggests that the ocular environment and encapsulation of screw by conjunctival tissue may have contributed to the lack of reactivity.  , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-24 21:52:15]

Medical College  Agra  Uttar Pradesh, , Free Paper, Retina, Comparison Of Optical Coherence Tomography Changes In The Macula Of Diabetic Patients Without Diabetic Retinopathy And Non-Diabetic Patients Undergoing Cataract Surgery: An Observational Study, , Purpose To study macular changes  after cataract surgery in diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy and non-diabetic patients. Then compare the two groups using OCT parameters. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing cataract surgery were taken up for the study and divided into 2 groups  Group A – Type 2 Diabetic patients with no diabetic retinopathy (100 patients) Group B—Non diabetic Patients with no macular pathology (100 patients) Central Subfield Thickness (CST)  Central Subfield Volume (CSV) and Thickness Average Cube (TAC) of  macula on OCT was measured before the cataract surgery which was kept as the baseline. At each follow-up on post operative day 1  day 7  3rd week  6th week  and 12th week after surgery all the above three parameters were documented.  Conclusion There was significant increase from baseline in CST  CSV and TAC in both the groups on 1st post op day which increased up to 6th week CST  CSV and TAC in Group A at 6th week was  269.36 µm ± 18.67  10.59 mm3 ± 0.57  239.34 µm ± 20.67 respectively. In Group B at 6th week was  267.59 µm ± 14.39  10.71 mm3 ± 0.62  239.83 µm ± 20.71 respectively. On comparing Group A and Group B there was no significant difference in all the three parameters on each follow up.  Macular oedema has a trend to increase up to 6 weeks regardless of diabetes after cataract surgery and then decrease. There is no significant difference in macular oedema in diabetics without diabetic retinopathy and non-diabetics undergoing cataract surgery. , DOS Members, BD-2184, Dr. Uday Singh Beri, beriuday@gmail.com, 8527450977, , DOS Members, S-6966, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Pediatric Ophthalmology, A study on risk factors and incidence of Retinopathy of Prematurity in a tertiary care hospital in UP, , Purpose : Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is a significant cause of childhood blindness  especially among premature infants with low birth weight. This study investigates the risk factors associated with ROP in premature infants admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Uttar Pradesh  India  aiming to inform clinical practices for reducing its incidence.  Method: This prospective observational study included preterm infants admitted to the NICU between October 2023 and December 2023. Infants with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks and a birth weight of less than 2000 grams were included. Data collection encompassed maternal and neonatal demographics  perinatal factors  and clinical parameters. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed regularly  and ROP was classified based on the International Committee for Classification of ROP criteria.   Conclusion : Of the 137 preterm infants examined  27 (19.7%) developed ROP. Significant risk factors included gestational age (P = 0.000)  sepsis (P = 0.004)  oxygen therapy (P = 0.018)  and frequency of blood transfusions (P = 0.030). Logistic regression analysis confirmed these factors as significant predictors of ROP. Among the affected neonates  21 (77.8%) experienced spontaneous regression  while 6 (22.2%) required laser intervention.  Gestational age  sepsis  oxygen therapy  and blood transfusions are significant risk factors for ROP. Early identification and management of these factors are crucial in preventing severe ROP and reducing the need for medical interventions., DOS Members, , Neelima Mehrotra, , , Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, DOS Members, , Kunwar Gaurav Singh, , , Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-25 16:19:26]

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 900 children (aged 5-15 years) attending our ophthalmology OPD. Evaluations included visual acuity assessment  cycloplegic refraction   slit-lamp examination  and fundus evaluation. Amblyopia was defined as a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) reduction of ?2 lines in one or both eyes  with no structural abnormality. Severity classification: mild (6/12)  moderate (6/18–6/36)  and severe (<6/36). Anisometropia was defined as a refractive difference of ?1.00D in hyperopia  ?1.50D in astigmatism  or ?2.00D in myopia. A questionnaire assessed demographics  referral sources  parental awareness  and functional challenges. Statistical analysis used chi-square tests and correlations (p < 0.05 significant). Results and Conclusion: Among 900 children with refractive errors  140 (15.56%) had anisometropia.  Amblyopia was detected in 40 cases  significantly higher in anisometropic children (p < 0.0001). The most common anisometropic types were compound myopic (32.1%). Amblyopia severity was classified as mild in 50.8% of cases  moderate in 37.7%  and severe in 11.5%. A significant association was found with family history (p = 0.0023)  yet 85% of parents were unaware of amblyopia  even among those with a family history (58.8%). Teacher referrals (67.5%) and school screenings (20%) played key roles in detection. Reported functional limitations included difficulty in reading  headaches  and struggles in daily tasks. Early detection through school screenings and improved parental awareness initiatives may enhance intervention and long-term visual outcomes.  , Non Members, , KAJAL SEEMA S, kajalseema@gmail.com, 9446090006, SUT ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Non Members, , MIDHUN S R, , 9074668243, SUT ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-25 17:45:31]

Studies have described a relationship between renal disease and changes in FAZ parameters (area  perimeter  and circularity) since both diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy are due to microangiopathy. The aim of this study was to compare disturbances in FAZ parameters in diabetic patients with or without overt nephropathy and to assess whether diabetic nephropathy as a biomarker of diabetic severity is correlated with increased macular nonperfusion. Methods: Patients were divided into two groups of diabetic retinopathy (DR)  namely  with overt nephropathy and without overt nephropathy. The FAZ parameters  including area  perimeter  and circularity  were measured using OCTA along with various biochemical and ocular parameters. A P value of < of<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant Result: A total of 62 patients (124 eyes) were enrolled in this study. All eyes with DR showed significant changes in FAZ parameters  but the FAZ area was larger in the superficial layer of OCT-A in patients with clinical albuminuria than in those with no microalbuminuria. (p = <0.001). Conclusion: OCTA provides detailed information on retinal microvasculature  which can be used to assess DR progression in patients with nephropathy. FAZ changes on OCTA in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) can be used as a surrogate marker for monitoring therapeutic response in DN patients. This approach could help personalize treatment strategies and improve outcomes for patients with advanced diabetic complications., Non Members, , dr. sidrah imran, minisidrahimarna@gmail.com, 9459620273, lady hardinge medical college, Non Members, , dr om prakash, prakash_2196@yahoo.co.in, 9810689930, lady hardinge medical college, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-25 18:18:11]

Methods: A 61 yrs old gentleman presented with diminution of vision in the left eye following cataract surgery 40 days back.The best corrected visual acuity was 6/9  N8 in the right eye and 6/18  N18 in the left eye. Slit lamp examination showed immature cataract in the right eye and pseudophakia in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed deep optic cup with subtle RPE alterations temporal to the disc in both the eyes.Optical coherence tomography of both the eyes demonstrated deep cup with outer retinal schisis  more in the left eye extending from temporal edge of the optic disc to fovea with features suggestive of an occult ONH pit. Patient was prescribed Dorzolamide eye drops and kept under observation. Patient presented after 6 weeks with further diminution of vision in the left eye recorded as counting fingers. OCT scan showed progression of outer retinal schisis with subfoveal neurosensory detachment and hyperreflective foci. Patient underwent left eye pars plana vitrectomy and ILM peeling with gas tamponade. Post surgery  OCT scan showed decrease in the size of outer retinal schisis with subsidence of neurosensory detachment and improvement in vision to 6/12.Thereafter  patient presented with diminution of vision to 2/60 in the right eye following cataract surgery. OCT scan showed progression of earlier maculopathy findings without visible ONH pit. Conclusion:Occult ONH pit maculopathy is a diagnostic challenging challenge.

Among the 26 eyes of the patients  5 underwent vitrectomy with additional procedures. The average visual acuity was 2.08 logMAR at 1 week  improving to 0.7 logMAR at 6 months.  CONCLUSION: RV is a serious condition that poses a significant threat to vision and is often a symptom of various underlying diseases  making treatments challenging. Proper evaluation and management should be customized for each patient. A thorough understanding of RV’s presentation and its potential systemic links can enhance diagnosis  treatment strategies  and overall patient outcomes. , Non Members, , Prof Dr. Shashidhar D, swamyshashidhar@gmail.com, 9845779330, MINTO OPHTHALMIC HOSPITAL BMCRI, Non Members, , Prof Dr.Shilpa, shilydev@gmail.com, 9448218120, MINTO OPHTHALMIC HOSPITAL BMCRI, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-26 19:25:17]

Ocular examination revealed BCVA 6/36   clear lens  and cup-to-disc ratio of 0.9 with severe visual field defects. The patient underwent uneventful trabeculectomy. On the first postoperative day  the IOP was 3 mmHg. The anterior chamber was well-formed  and the bleb was functional with Seidel-negative. Fundus examination revealed a surprising reduction in optic disc cupping to 0.4:1  without evidence of choroidal detachment or hypotony maculopathy.  The patient was managed conservatively with oral and topical corticosteroids  along with cycloplegics. On follow-up two weeks later  the optic disc cupping had reverted to 0.9:1  and the IOP was 15mmhg.  Similarly   A 34-year-old male diagnosed with JOAG underwent trabeculectomy. Preoperative examination revealed a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.9:1  with significant visual field loss . On postoperative day 1  the patient developed hypotony  during which the cupping was noted to decrease to 0.4:1. Interestingly  there were no other  signs of hypotony such as choroidal detachment  maculopathy  or visual acuity changes. The patient was managed conservatively with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics. Three weeks postoperatively  the cup-to-disc ratio increased back to 0.9:1.  Conclusion - This case illustrates that the reversal of cupping during postoperative hypotony should not be interpreted as true structural improvement of glaucomatous damage. Instead  it is due to hypotony-induced changes  such as pseudo-disc edema  which can temporarily alter the appearance of the optic nerve head.   , DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-26 20:04:00]

Group A received intravitreal injection of bevacizumab  group B received ranibizumab  and group C received intravitreal steroids. EGFR and serum creatinine were measured at baseline and at 1  3  and 6 months after the therapy. Mean number of injections  change in blood pressure after intravitreal injection  duration of diabetes were also recorded Results: After adjusting for age  HbA1c  and gender  the anti-VEGF group showed a significant reduction in eGFR and an increase in creatinine at 1  3  and 6 months compared to the steroid group (p<0.05). Between the type of anti-VEGF used  there was no significant difference in increase in creatinine and decrease in EGFR at 1 and 3 months. However  a significant difference was noted at 6 months with eGFR significantly lower in Avastin (53 ± 20.82 mL/min/1.73 m²) vs. Razumab (74.24 ± 29.54 mL/min/1.73 m²  p = 0.038) and higher creatinine levels in Avastin (1.5 [1.2–1.9] mg/dL) vs. Razumab (0.97 [0.827–1.372] mg/dL  p = 0.021). Conclusion: Our study shows that anti-VEGF drugs significantly affect the kidney function tests  so a thorough evaluation of kidney function before starting a patient on anti-VEGF therapy and also while on therapy should be done. , DOS Members, B-8009, Dr. Arjun Bamel, arjunbamel@gmail.com, 0801 071 1070, Dr Shroff Charity Eye Hospital  New Delhi, Non Members, , Dr R Rajalakshmi, drraj@@drmohans.com, , Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities centre and Madras Diabetes Research foundation  Chennai , DOS Members, A-1045, DR.

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of early detection through ocular examination in patients presenting with visual disturbances  as these may indicate the presence of intracranial space-occupying lesions (ICSOL)  such as oligodendrogliomas.  Method A 26-year-old male presented with complaints of headache  blurred vision  and vertigo. His ocular examination revealed slightly reduced visual acuity and papilledema  indicative of raised intracranial pressure. Visual field testing was conducted  and further imaging was performed after a strong suspicion of a neurological disorder was raised. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was carried out to identify any underlying pathology.  Results MRI revealed an ill-defined  altered signal intensity mass in the left occipital lobe  accompanied by perilesional edema and mass effect  suggesting a Grade II oligodendroglioma. Visual field analysis showed a right-sided homonymous hemianopia  which further supported the suspicion of a neurological condition.  Conclusion This case emphasizes the critical role of ophthalmologists in the early detection of brain tumors. Visual disturbances  especially when associated with papilledema  can be indicative of intracranial space-occupying lesions such as oligodendrogliomas. Early identification and appropriate imaging can lead to timely intervention  potentially improving patient outcomes. Early diagnosis is essential  as these tumors often remain asymptomatic until advanced stages. , Non Members, , Dr. Ruta  Walavalkar, rutawalavalkar@gmail.com, 9167694131, ESIC Hospital  Basaidarapur New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-26 20:25:47]

METHOD: This is double randomized control study  conducted on patients clinically diagnosed as having keratitis. Study comprises 2 groups (case group) treated with topical insulin prepared at concentration of 1 IU/ml in regular insulin solution diluted with lubricating eye drop  prescribing 4 times a day along with conventional treatment (tab fluconazole  E/d natamycin etc.) and other is (control group) receiving conventional treatment only. Primary efficacy end points were the percentage of patients in which epithelization was achieved as well as rate and time until epithelization using slit lamp examination and ASOCT. CONCLUSION: Epithelization was achieved in 72 patients (72%) on insulin and 28 patients (28%) on conventional treatment. In those patients  mean time until reepithelization was 32.6+/-28.3 days (range 4–124) in the insulin group and 82.6+/- 82.4 days (range 13–231) in the conventional treatment group. Topical insulin is an effective treatment and safely promotes healing of corneal ulcer  presented better epithelization outcomes than the conventional treatment alone. , Non Members, , Dr. Prof. Pankaj Chaudhary, pankaj17choudhary@gmail.com, 9826468847, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa., Non Members, , Aditi Kaintura, leelakaintura97@gmail.com, 8826777587, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa., Non Members, , Garima Dhurve, gdhurve11@gmail.com, 7999190930, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa., Non Members, , Garima Mandloi, garima2696@gmail.com, 8269746735, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa, 2025-03-26 23:11:03]

The occurrence of SESCH is infrequent  with only a limited number of reported cases worldwide  primarily from developing countries. This report presents the case of a 77-year-old male who experienced SESCH. The patient arrived at the emergency department complaining of painful bleeding from his left eye. Additionally  he had not been using any anticoagulants. Upon examination  the right eye’s visual acuity was Perception of Light (PL) positive  though Projection of Rays (PR) was inaccurate  while the left eye had PL negative. A slit-lamp examination revealed that the right eye was pseudophakic  while the left eye demonstrated expulsion of all intraocular contents  resulting in a disorganized globe with active bleeding. Fundus examination of the right eye showed glaucomatous optic atrophy with a grossly normal peripheral retina. Laboratory tests showed low platelet count and deranged coagulation profile. Risk factors for SESCH in this patient included advanced age  atherosclerosis  advanced glaucoma  renal failure  decompensated liver disease with abnormal coagulation profile  and uncontrolled hypertension. The patient ultimately underwent evisceration of the left eye. SESCH is an exceedingly rare occurrence  typically affecting diseased eyes in elderly patients., DOS Members, AD-2167, Dr. RAISA ARORA, drraisatandon@gmail.com, 8755769487, ESIC PGIMSR Model Hospital Basaidarapur , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-26 23:22:11]

Dilation and incompetence of the Juxtafoveolar capillaries lead to visual loss related to intraretinal edema and/or the development of choroidal neovascularization.   Case Report A 55-year-old woman experienced painless  slowly progressive blurred and distorted vision in her left eye for two years  which she initially thought was due to cataracts. She had a BCVA 20/50 in left eye. Her right eye was asymptomatic. She had mild hypertension and arthritis  managed with Telmisartan and Naproxen. The woman was diagnosed with Idiopathic Juxtafoveal Retinal Telangiectasis (IJRT)  a rare condition characterized by abnormal blood vessels near the fovea. These vessels  called telangiectasias  leak fluid or blood into the retina  impairing vision. The condition is of unknown cause and typically does not have specific systemic associations.  Differential Diagnosis When IJRT is suspected  it must be differentiated from venous occlusive disease  diabetic retinopathy  radiation retinopathy  eales’ disease  sickle cell maculopathy and tuberous sclerosis.  Discussion Idiopathic Juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis is a rare disorder  and appears to be caused primarily by retinal capillary serous and lipid exudation in group 1. Capillary diffusion abnormalities in group 2. Capillary occlusive ischemia in group 3. In developing a management plan  it is important to subclassify patients by utilizing both biomicroscopic and angiographic findings. Subclassiication of groups include those which are predominantly exudative and non-familial (groups 1A and 1B)   No financial support no conflicts of interest , Non Members, , Dr. S.P.Singh, , , MANOHAR DAS EYE HOSPITAL  MOTILAL NEHRU MEDICAL COLLEGE  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , Dr. Jitendra Singh, , , MANOHAR DAS EYE HOSPITAL  MOTILAL NEHRU MEDICAL COLLEGE  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , Dr. Ayusha Rawat, , , MANOHAR DAS EYE HOSPITAL  MOTILAL NEHRU MEDICAL COLLEGE  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-27 00:13:43]

Amongst it many types  butterfly pattern dystrophy (BPD) is quite rare. In this poster  we describe a unique case of a 62 year old female who presented with recent onset metamorphopsia in both eyes. On initial examination BCVA was 6/6  N6 in both eye with fundus examination revealing a classic “butterfly wing” configuration at maculae and OCT showing outer retinal layer disruption in both eyes. FAF and ERG (showing reduced central and paracentral response) further allowed the diagnosis of BPD to be made.  On serial follow up  she was noted to have subretinal fluid (SRF) on OCT and choroidal neovascular membrane(CNVM) on OCT-A only in the right eye (RE)  after 1 year. The patient was treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF  ranibizumab injections after which SRF decreased. On further follow up  she had SRF on OCT and CNVM on OCT-A exclusively in the right eye (RE) at 6 monthly intervals which reduced with injection anti-VEGF but reappeared regularly.  The left eye remained stable and BCVA of both eyes was maintained since initial presentation  revealing the unpredictable nature of unilateral CNVM in an apparently bilateral disease.  This case emphasizes how butterfly pattern dystrophy  though typically symmetrical  can behave unpredictably with CNVM developing in just one eye. It reinforces the importance for regular follow ups and multimodal imaging  as early changes can be subtle and easily missed without close follow-up.  , Non Members, , Dr Shailaja S, shailaja.s@manipal.edu, 9686125861, Kasturba Medical College  Manipal, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-27 11:11:15]

Methods: This cross-sectional study included patients above 40 years with a confirmed diagnosis of POAG. Dry eye was assessed using Schirmer’s test  tear breakup time (TBUT)  Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score  and tear film meniscus height. The prevalence and severity of dry eye were analyzed  and associations with antiglaucoma medications  particularly prostaglandin analogs and preservatives  were evaluated. Statistical significance was determined using appropriate tests. Results and Conclusion: Dry eye was observed in 86% of glaucoma patients  with greater severity in those using antiglaucoma medications containing preservatives. Patients on prostaglandin analogs exhibited a higher prevalence of dry eye. All dry eye assessment tools showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between medicated and non-medicated groups. Dry eye disease is highly prevalent among glaucoma patients  particularly in those on preserved antiglaucoma medications  with prostaglandin analogs posing a higher risk.

METHOD: This is double randomized control study  conducted on patients clinically diagnosed as having keratitis. Study comprises 2 groups (case group) treated with topical insulin prepared at concentration of 1 IU/ml in regular insulin solution diluted with lubricating eye drop  prescribing 4 times a day along with conventional treatment and other is (control group) receiving conventional treatment (Tab. fluconazole  E/d natamycin etc.)only. Primary efficacy end points were the percentage of patients in which epithelization was achieved as well as rate and duration of epithelization were evaluated  using slit lamp examination and ASOCT. CONCLUSION: Epithelization was achieved in 72 patients (72%) on insulin and 28 patients (28%) on conventional treatment. In those patients  mean time until reepithelization was 32.6+/-28.3 days (range 4–124) in the insulin group and 82.6+/- 82.4 days (range 13–231) in the conventional treatment group. Topical insulin is an effective treatment and safely promotes healing of corneal ulcer  presented better epithelization outcomes than the conventional treatment alone. , Non Members, , Dr. Prof. Pankaj Chaudhary, pankaj17choudhary@gmail.com, 9826468847, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa., Non Members, , Aditi Kaintura, leelakaintura97@gmail.com, 8826777587, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa., Non Members, , Garima Dhurve, gdhurve11@gmail.com, 7999190930, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa., Non Members, , Garima Mandloi, garima2696@gmail.com, 8269746735, S.S. medical college Gandhi memorial hospital rewa, 2025-03-27 18:02:25]

The distinction between these two conditions is crucial  as pseudopapilledema often requires urgent treatment.  Case Presentation: A 12-year-old girl presented with progressive vision loss in both eyes over a period of 6 months. Ophthalmic examination revealed elevated optic discs with yellowish deposits  initially suspected to be optic neuritis .  The patients visual acuity was 20/60 in both eyes.  Investigations: Further evaluation with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography and oct never head confirmed the presence of disc drusen . The OCT scans showed characteristic deposits on the optic disc  while the fluorescein angiography revealed no evidence of leakage or inflammation.  Management: The patient was monitored regularly  and her vision was stabilized with glasses correction. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patients condition and adjust treatment as needed.  Outcome: The patients vision improved slightly over the course of 12 months  with a final visual acuity of 20/40 in both eyes. The patient was able to resume normal activities  including school and sports.  Conclusion: Disc drusen can masquerade as pseudopapilledema  leading to diagnostic confusion.

INTRODUCTION Iris cyst is an epithelial – lined cyst that involves a layer of the iris. Primary iris cysts originate in the iris pigment epithelium or iris stroma  and secondary iris cysts are stimulated by outside factors. These cysts vary in size  shape  and location within the iris and can sometimes present with visual disturbances  elevated intraocular pressure  or discomfort. CASE REPORT Case of 48 year old male presented with chief complaints of diminution of vision for near with photophobia .Examination revealed a fusiform anterior elevation of iris stroma.Diagnosis of iris cyst was made by AS-OCT and UBM.In this case a trial of NDYAG laser was given to the patient which lead to resolution of the cyst. CONCLUSION  Proper examination on slit lamp along with AS-OCT and UBM are mandatory in detailed evaluation of iris cyst.  Most of these cysts are quite rare  but some can cause visual problems  requiring treatment. Although 76% of cases are benign  differential diagnosis is crucial to rule out more se¬rious problems  mainly malignancies. , DOS Members, VD-2007, Dr. SHWETA VERMA, SHWETAVERMA@GMAIL.COM, 8700269751, Vmmc and Sjh, DOS Members, GD-1558, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Retina, Managing Massive - Submacular Haemorrhage: An Ocular Emergency , , Purpose: Sub-macular haemorrhage is the accumulation of blood in the sub-retinal space due to underlying pathology  most commonly a polyp in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy  although other differentials are not so uncommon. Through this case series  the authors have demonstrated successful management of massive sub-macular haemorrhage. Methods: We aim to describe the outcome of surgical management in though this case series of three patients with massive subretinal bleeding due to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. The procedure includes 3-port pars plana vitrectomy  careful peeling of the posterior hyaloid with a sub-retinal injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator agent (rTPA) (25-50 ?g/0.1 ml) for lysis of the clot via 38-guage flexible subretinal cannula along with the intravitreal injection of aflibercept 2mg/0.05 ml. Two patients were injected rTPA manually  while the third was injected via connecting the syringes plunger to the vitrectomy machines extrusion system with a controlled infusion pressure of 10 mm Hg. Patients were then followed over and received subsequent three-monthly doses of intravitreal aflibercept to manage the underlying pathology.  Results: The final follow-up at the end of three months of surgery showing remarkable anatomical and functional recovery  seen as improvement in visual acuity and resolution of the haemorrhage. Conclusion: Sub-macular haemorrhage should be considered as an emergency as delayed intervention can lead to permanent vision compromise. The management does not end with the surgery rather it requires repetitive intravitreal injection of anti-VEGFs to take care of the underlying pathology , DOS Members, V-371, DR.

Sharma PGIMS   Rohtak   Haryana, , Physical Poster, Glaucoma, Phacolytic Glaucoma Mimicking Endogenous Endophthalmitis: A Diagnostic Dilemma, , Purpose: To highlight the diagnostic challenge of phacolytic glaucoma mimicking endogenous endophthalmitis and emphasize the importance of clinical evaluation and imaging in differentiating these conditions. Methods: A 72-year-old female presented with complaints of progressive vision loss  pain  and redness in the right eye for 10–14 days. She had no history of trauma  surgery  fever  or systemic infection. Clinical examination revealed conjunctival congestion  corneal edema  anterior chamber exudates  and a mid-dilated fixed pupil  raising suspicion of both phacolytic glaucoma and endogenous endophthalmitis. Ultrasound B-scan showed a normal posterior segment  ruling out endophthalmitis. The patient was managed with topical steroids and subsequently underwent lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation. Results: Postoperatively  the patient’s symptoms resolved  intraocular pressure normalized  and visual acuity improved to 6/9 by one week. The early diagnosis and appropriate management prevented further complications  confirming the final diagnosis of phacolytic glaucoma. Conclusion: Phacolytic glaucoma is a vision-threatening but preventable complication of hypermature cataracts. It can closely mimic endophthalmitis  making early clinical assessment and imaging crucial for accurate diagnosis. This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness about lens-induced glaucomas and their timely surgical intervention to prevent irreversible vision loss. , DOS Members, S-902, Dr. SUMIT SACHDEVA, sumitsachdeva@rediffmail.com, 9355611415, Pt.

Methods: A hospital-based  cross-sectional observational study was conducted at ESIC Medical College and Hospital  Faridabad  including 40 children (>3 years) clinically diagnosed with spastic CP. Participants were divided into two groups: 20 term and 20 preterm children. Each child underwent comprehensive ophthalmological evaluation  including visual acuity testing  cycloplegic refraction  assessment of ocular motility  and fundoscopy. Brain MRI was performed in all cases. Data were analyzed statistically to assess the correlation between gestational age  ocular findings  and radiological abnormalities.  Conclusion: Ocular and oculomotor abnormalities were highly prevalent in children with spastic CP  with refractive errors and strabismus being the most common findings. Preterm children exhibited more severe myopia and a higher incidence of retinopathy of prematurity and periventricular leukomalacia. MRI findings correlated significantly with clinical manifestations.

Methods: A retrospective case series was conducted involving three patients diagnosed with anemic retinopathy. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations were performed  including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) testing  slit-lamp biomicroscopy  and dilated fundus examination. Imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to document retinal changes. Concurrent hematological investigations assessed the severity and etiology of anemia. Patients received tailored systemic treatment in collaboration with a hematologist  and follow-up examinations were performed to evaluate the response. Results: All cases exhibited fundus findings consistent with anemic retinopathy  including retinal hemorrhages  cotton wool spots  and Roth spots. OCT demonstrated variable degrees of inner retinal layer thickening and disruption in areas corresponding to ischemic changes. The underlying causes of anemia ranged from nutritional deficiencies to chronic blood loss. Systemic correction of the anemia resulted in significant regression of retinal lesions and improvement in visual acuity in two of the three patients  highlighting the reversible nature of these changes when diagnosed and managed promptly. Conclusion: This case series underscores that anemic retinopathy  though rare  presents with distinctive retinal features that require comprehensive systemic evaluation. Early detection and coordinated care between ophthalmology and hematology are essential for preventing irreversible vision loss and may facilitate substantial visual recovery., DOS Members, S-902, Dr. SUMIT SACHDEVA, sumitsachdeva@rediffmail.com, 9355611415, Pt.

Agarwal Trophy , Cornea & Ocular Surface, Efficacy of Interferon Alfa-2b in the Management of Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia, , Purpose: To assess the efficacy of interferon Alfa-2b in the management of Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN).                                        Introduction: OSSN encompasses a wide disease spectrum ranging from conjunctival and corneal intraepithelial lesion to squamous cell cancer. Management can be surgical with excision or medical with the use of mitomycin C  5-fluorouracil and interferon Alfa-2b.  Method: This is a case series of two patients of OSSN who had presented to the out-patient department. Case 1  a 56-year-old male presented with pain in left eye.  Examination revealed a gelatinous mass covering peripheral cornea and conjunctiva from 5-11 clock hours with overlying feeder vessels. Case 2  a 58-year-old female presented with complaint of foreign body sensation of right eye. On examination  irregular whitish lesion was noted involving conjunctiva and cornea from 5-2 clock hours with underlying corneal scarring. In both cases  impression cytology revealed dysplastic squamous cells suggestive of OSSN. Both patients were started on eyedrop interferon Alfa-2b in concentration of 1 million IU/ml four times per day. Subconjunctival injections of interferon Alfa-2b were administered in the concentration of 3 million IU/0.5ml every two weeks. Case 1 showed complete resolution at 6 weeks after administration of three such doses while case 2 required two additional doses before resolution was noted at 10 weeks. Topical interferon Alfa-2b was continued for 2 months post-resolution to prevent recurrence.  Conclusion: Topical chemotherapy is emerging as an effective alternative to surgical procedures. It is preferred as primary treatment as it is effective both pre- and post-operatively. , DOS Members, SD-1667, Dr. PRANITA SAHAY, drpranitasahay@gmail.com, 9871429421, Dr. R P Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS, DOS Members, TD-2021, Dr. Vaishali Tomar, vishutomar95@gmail.com, 9971232870, GURU NANAK EYE CENTRE  MAULANA AZAD MEDICAL COLLEGE, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-27 23:36:45]

This case report highlights the surgical approach and post-operative management of a 5-year-old boy with chemical burn caused by a coal-particle along with singeing over the ocular adnexa. Methods-The patient presented with alleged history of burn trauma to left-eye 3 days back causing sudden  painful  profound swelling associated with redness. Clinical examination revealed burn and chemical deposits associated with inflammation. Surgical intervention involved wound exploration  removal of the foreign body (3x4cm coal particle)  scleral patch-grafting  and amniotic-membrane transplantation under general anaesthesia. Removal of the foreign body from sclera is challenging due to risk of vitreous loss. If foreign body is removed without grafting  there are high chance of ectasia. Post-operative care included topical steroids  antibiotics  cycloplegics  lubricants  along with oral anti-inflammatory agents. Results-At discharge  patient’s swelling and inflammation had reduced significantly  with preserved corneal integrity. The visual prognosis remained guarded  requiring close monitoring. Compliance with medications and protective measures-(dark glasses  hygiene precautions) was emphasized. Patient was scheduled for follow-up one-week post discharge to assess healing and visual recovery. Conclusion-Early surgical intervention  combined with medical management  is critical in ocular burn injuries. Scleral patch grafting prevents globe rupture  infection  and scleral thinning (staphyloma) while maintaining ocular integrity. It helps to avoid vitreous loss and structural weakening after foreign body removal. Amniotic membrane transplantation reduces inflammation  promotes epithelial healing  minimizes scarring  helps conjunctivalization of graft  and helps improve long term visual-prognosis.  *Authors declare no financial-relationships or conflicts of interest., Non Members, , Prof. Harsh Bahadur, harshbahadur@srhu.edu.in, 9412909376, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences  Jolly Grant  Dehradun, Non Members, , Dr. Sukriti Upadhyay, sukritiupadhyay010@gmail.com, 9079021140, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences  Jolly Grant  Dehradun, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-27 23:48:41]

Methods: We conducted a prospective comparative parallel design study. Eye drops were emptied into unlabeled vials and labelled A or B. Different drops were instilled into each eye using a coin toss method. We instilled the eye drops twice  10 minutes apart  and recorded dilation and cycloplegia using an Autorefractometer  starting 5 minutes later  for every 5 minutes for 30 minutes  then every 10 minutes for the next 30 minutes  and every 20 minutes for the next hour. We used paired t-tests for analyses.  Conclusion:  Of 31 children  14 were males with age of 13.48±3.56 years. CP achieved maximum cycloplegia at 29.52±28.35 minutes compared to 20.80±19.75 minutes with CP&T (95%CI for difference: 0.62 to 18.04) and maximum mydriasis at 93.23±24.82 minutes vs 45.65±30.49 minutes for CP vs CP&T (95%CI for difference: 33.89 to 61.27). Interestingly  with both the drugs  maximum cycloplegia occurred significantly earlier than mydriasis: for CP&T 24.8 (95%CI: 13.9 to 35.8) and CP 63.7 (95%CI: 51.9 to 75.5). Our study suggests that the combination of CP&T drops provide a quicker maximum cycloplegia  by an average of 9 minutes  and significantly faster mydriasis by an average of 48 minutes  compared to CP alone.  The combination should be preferred in busy clinics to both save time and improve efficiency. Maximum cycloplegia is achieved well before mydriasis with both the drugs.   , DOS Members, A-473, Dr. ABADAN KHAN AMITAVA, akamitava@gmail.com, 7906251522, JNMC  Aligarh Muslim University, DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-28 18:43:02]

While infantile hemangiomas are typically self-limiting  cavernous hemangiomas often require intervention when symptomatic. Propranolol and timolol have emerged as effective medical treatments  reducing lesion size and associated complications. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 23-year-old male who presented with progressive right eye proptosis and diplopia. His symptoms began 10 years prior with a sudden onset of proptosis  preceded by episodic throbbing pain and associated with diminished vision. MRI and Color Doppler imaging suggested an orbital hemangioma or lymphangioma. The patient had visited multiple medical facilities without relief. On examination  he exhibited axial proptosis  ptosis  mild hyperphoria  and exotropia. Fundoscopy revealed a hypermetropic disc with venous dilation and tortuosity. He had developed amblyopia in the affected eye  with a Best Corrected Visual Acuity of 6/36 for distance and J3 for near vision. Treatment was initiated with sustained-release propranolol (40 mg daily) and topical timolol (0.5% twice daily). Over one year of follow-up  the patient showed marked improvement in proptosis and a significant reduction in lesion size. Conclusion: This case highlights the effectiveness of propranolol and timolol in managing long-standing orbital hemangiomas  demonstrating a non-surgical approach for symptom relief and lesion regression. Early diagnosis and medical intervention can help preserve visual function and improve cosmetic outcomes. , Non Members, , Dr Kalpna Jain, kalpnadaga@gmail.com, 9929598989, Sardar Patel Medical College   Bikaner, Non Members, , Dr Poonam Bhargawa, pbrc1306@gmail.com, 9413682550, Sardar Patel Medical College   Bikaner, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-28 20:49:16]

Agarwal Trophy , Retina, Efficacy and Safety of Razumab for retinal diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis, , Introduction: Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factors like Ranibizumab have been shown to be efficacious and safe for treating retinal diseases  but high cost limits their use. Biosimilar drugs provide a more affordable alternative. Razumab (Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  Ahmedabad  India)  a ranibizumab biosimilar  was approved in India in 2015. Despite promising results  there is a lack of unbiased  independent systematic reviews and meta-analysis on its safety and efficacy.  Methodology: Systematic searches were conducted on Ovid MEDLINE  PUBMED  Web of Science  EMBASE  SCOPUS and Cochrane.  Principal results: 16 studies with a total of 3670 eyes  and 1 safety trial with 9406 eyes were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. There was a significant improvement in best corrected visual acuity  a decrease in central macular thickness in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration  diabetic macular edema and macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion  and significant regression in retinopathy of prematurity  but there was heterogeneity between the studies and potential publication biases. The overall proportion of adverse events was around 17.1%  with the majority being non-serious.  Conclusions: This study showed that Razumab led to improvement in visual outcomes and a decrease in retinal thickness with an acceptable safety profile  but there was variability and potential publication biases in the studies included. Long-term and independent trials are needed for greater evidence., DOS Members, , , meenakshithakar147@gmail.com , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-28 20:50:08]

Methods: A prospective analysis was conducted on 44 patients aged 40+ with non-resolving non-diabetic vitreous hemorrhage lasting over three months. Patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation  including risk factor assessment  BCVA measurement  anterior segment examination  fundoscopy  and B-scan imaging. All patients underwent three-port PPV  with visual and surgical outcomes assessed on postoperative day 1  1 week  1 month  3 months  and 6 months.  Results: The most common cause of non-diabetic vitreous hemorrhage was retinal vein occlusion (54.5%)  followed by trauma (22.7%). Notable improvements in BCVA were seen in 20 patients achieving 6/12 or better. Surgical interventions included pars plana vitrectomy with or without endolaser  ILM peeling  and silicone oil tamponade (7 patients)  gas injection (5 patients). Two patients experienced rebleeding at 3 months  requiring vitreous lavage. One patient developed cataract formation and underwent subsequent cataract surgery.  Conclusion: In patients over 40  evaluating non-diabetic causes of vitreous hemorrhage is crucial  as conditions like retinal vein occlusion  trauma  CNVM  and iatrogenic causes require targeted management. Identifying the underlying cause enables appropriate intervention  impacting visual and surgical outcomes.

Methods: A 28-year-old male reported a 6-month history of sudden painless  central visual loss in the right eye. He had sustained blunt ocular trauma 7 years earlier  with no ophthalmic evaluation until symptom onset. Best-corrected visual acuity was 6/60. Fundus examination and spectral-domain OCT confirmed a chronic full-thickness grade 4 macular hole with complete posterior vitreous detachment and no spontaneous closure.  Conclusion: In chronic macular holes  especially post-traumatic cases  surgical intervention offers the best visual prognosis. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and gas tamponade remains the gold standard. Recent advancements—such as the inverted ILM flap technique  use of autologous platelet concentrate  or human amniotic membrane plug—have improved closure rates in chronic and large holes. In phakic patients  lens-sparing vitrectomy may preserve accommodation. Long-acting gas tamponades like C3F8 enhance anatomical success. Additionally  OCT angiography (OCTA) can help assess foveal microvasculature preoperatively and predict postoperative outcomes.

The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of both techniques in restoring vision and minimizing postoperative complications. Method A prospective cohort study was conducted at LLRM Medical College  Meerut  involving 58 patients. Group A (n=17) underwent DSEK  while Group B (n=41) received PK. Patients were selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Preoperative assessments included visual acuity  intraocular pressure  and anterior/posterior segment evaluation. Surgical techniques were performed with standardized protocols  and postoperative follow-ups were conducted at multiple intervals up to six months. Results Both groups showed significant improvements in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA). DSEK improved BCVA from a mean logMAR of 1.64 to 0.90  while PK improved from 1.69 to 1.11. At six months  58.8% of DSEK patients achieved complete graft clarity (+0) compared to 53.6% in the PK group. Complications differed  with graft dislocation more common in DSEK (18%) and graft rejection (10%) and primary graft failure (7%) more frequent in PK. Conclusion DSEK demonstrated superior graft clarity and fewer immune-related complications  while PK remained the preferred option for a wider range of corneal conditions. Although the visual outcome differences were not statistically significant  DSEK may be more beneficial in cases requiring selective endothelial replacement. , DOS Members, S-3732, Dr. LOKESH KUMAR SINGH, drlokeshgeorgian2000@yahoo.com, 9720070704, LLRM medical College meerut , DOS Members, G-73, Dr. ALKA GUPTA, dralkag@gmail.com, 9412201639, LLRM medical College meerut , DOS Members, D-6474, Dr. JAISHREE DWIVEDI, DRJAISHREEDWIVEDI@GMAIL.COM, 9837502847, LLRM medical College meerut , DOS Members, M-4316, Dr. ANU MALIK, docanu.20@gmail.com, 8376836455, RP center AIIMS New Delhi , 2025-03-28 22:36:25]

Examination revealed BCVA 6/6p and 6/9 in right and left eye respectively  showed chronic stable low IOP’s on  AT( 4 mmhg RE and 5mmhg in LE) and negative seidel’s test without signs of hypotony maculopathy despite severe RNFL and GCC thinning in BE on OCT and advance damage on visual fields.    Discussion & Conclusion- This case highlights that not all low IOP cases lead to hypotony maculopathy. Possible protective factors include: gradual IOP decline  scleral rigidity  choroidal stability  bleb function with controlled filtration and no ciliary body dysfunction preventing severe hypotony. The goal is to maintain a balanced IOP to avoid structural damage  particularly to the macula. Hypotony often considered a poor outcome  however some patients maintain good vision despite low IOP. Long term follow up identify potential risk factors for complications and can provide evidence that not all hypotony cases require intervention  reinforcing individualized patient management. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-28 23:04:56]

The objective is to highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of this surgical approach in addressing lens dislocation in the paediatric age group with Marfan syndrome.  Method:  A 10-year-old male patient with a confirmed diagnosis of Marfan syndrome presented with bilateral lens subluxation  resulting in significant visual impairment. After a thorough preoperative evaluation  the patient underwent cataract extraction and retro pupillary iris-fixated IOL implantation in both eyes. The surgical procedure was performed under general anesthesia  and IOL positioning was carefully adjusted to ensure optimal fixation and alignment. Postoperative follow-up occurred at regular intervals over 3 months to monitor visual outcomes  IOL stability  and potential complications.  Result:  Following the surgery  the patient demonstrated a significant improvement in visual acuity  from finger count at 1.5m in the right eye and finger count at 1m in the left eye preoperatively to 6/36 at one month and to 6/18 at 3 month. IOL stability was maintained  with no dislocation or significant complications observed during each follow up. There was no evidence of postoperative complications such as infection  elevated intraocular pressure  or iris damage. The patient reported improved quality of life with enhanced functional vision.  Conclusion: This case report supports retro pupillary iris-fixated IOL implantation as an effective and safe surgical option for managing lens subluxation in paediatric patients with Marfan syndrome. The procedure resulted in significant visual improvement and IOL stability  with minimal postoperative complications. Retro pupillary iris-fixated IOLs offer a promising solution for addressing lens dislocation in children with Marfan syndrome  although further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to validate long-term outcomes., DOS Members, S-902, Sumit Sachdeva, www.sumitsachdeva@rediffmail.com, 7015851836, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, DOS Members, R-583, Manisha Rathi, www.manisharathi@hotmail.com, 9813381899, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, Non Members, , Priyanka Saini, www.priyankasaini71@gmail.com, 9818671612, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, Non Members, , Kanupriya Viz, www.drkanupriyavij@gmail.com, 7973216953, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, 2025-03-28 23:16:01]

A total of 20 eyes from 20 patients were enrolled in the study  with 10 eyes in each group. Group A received bevacizumab via the intrastromal route  and Group B received it via the subconjunctival route. All patients were followed for a period of 6 months. The procedures were performed in the operating room under full aseptic precautions  with topical proparacaine hydrochloride used for local anesthesia. For the subconjunctival injection  0.1ml of bevacizumab (2.5mg/0.1ml) was administered near the limbus  adjacent to the pathological vessels growing into or onto the cornea  using a 30-gauge needle. In the intrastromal group  0.1ml of bevacizumab (2.5mg/0.1ml) was injected intrastromally at the distal end of the corneal neovascularization. The study population consisted mainly of males (with more males than females)  and 80% were aged over 41 years. The most common causes of corneal neovascularization were graft failure (50%)  viral keratitis (20%)  chemical burns (20%)  loose sutures (5%)  and trauma (5%). There was no significant change in intraocular pressure (IOP) or graft clarity after the injection of bevacizumab in both groups A and B  suggesting no adverse effects from the drug administration.both the two routes are equally effective in treating corneal neovascularisation in post penetrating keratoplasty., Non Members, , shivani kihna, shivanikihna132@gmail.com, 8937073486, subharti medical college, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 11:24:47]

The study highlights how the BPES can be linked to corneal involvement  leading to visual impairment due to irregular astigmatism.  By presenting a case of a 55-year-old male with BPES and keratoconus  the study aims to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and management of keratoconus in BPES patients. The findings suggest that ophthalmologists should screen BPES patients for irregular corneal astigmatism or keratoconus to prevent potential vision loss.  The study follows a case report METHODOLOGY  analyzing a 55-year-old male with BPES and keratoconus.  Methods: 	1.	Clinical Examination: Assessed visual acuity (BCVA)  eyelid abnormalities (BPES features)  and corneal changes. 	2.	Diagnostic Tests: Corneal topography  anterior segment OCT confirmed keratoconus with scarring. 	3.	Surgical Intervention: Penetrating keratoplasty  cataract extraction  and PCIOL implantation were performed in the left eye. 	4.	Follow-up: Postoperative BCVA improved to 6/18  with a clear graft at 6 months.  The study highlights the rare BPES-keratoconus association and stresses early screening to prevent vision loss.  The study CONCLUDES that patients with BPES and a history of decreased vision since childhood should be evaluated for keratoconus  as undiagnosed cases can lead to amblyopia and permanent visual impairment. The association between BPES and keratoconus may be linked to abnormal eyelid posture affecting corneal biomechanics.  Early screening  diagnosis  and intervention are crucial in BPES patients to prevent vision loss. Awareness of this potential link can help clinicians adjust management strategies  improving patient outcomes., Non Members, , DR MALHAR VYAS, malharvyas87@gmail.com, 8527710981, NIMS UNIVERSITY JAIPUR, DOS Members, A-18, Dr. T.S.

Patient’s husband gave a history of sudden inward deviation starting 1.5 hours after taking tablet misoprostol. She then went to a private hospital  where her pupils were dilated for fundus examination. She claimed that her inward deviation improved after the instillation of dilating drops. Patient also gave history of giving birth via normal vaginal delivery in January 2024. On examination  BCVA was -4DS 6/9 in both eyes at presentation  and her eyes showed inward deviation  with ocular movements limited in all the other gazes. Patient was then cyclopleged using eyedrop homatropine  after which her ocular movements improved in all the gazes and there was a significant difference in her refraction with BCVA of -0.5DS and -1.DC at 180? 6/9 in both the eyes. Fundus examination was within normal limits. This remarkable improvement in her ocular movements and decrease in spherical power post cycloplegia is suggestive of accommodative spasm. This is an unusual presentation  and the patient was advised eyedrop atropine (1%) two times a day  in both her eyes and counselled to wear glasses for near vision at half a metre distance., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 13:26:19]

METHOD: This is a prospective study  conducted on patients clinically diagnosed as having keratitis. Study comprises carrying out AS-OCT using Cirrus HD OCT 500 by Carl Zeiss (Spectral Domain Technology) along with Slit Lamp on day 0 3 7th day 2nd week 4th week and 6th week. All patients underwent treatment based on clinical findings and various investigations to know which type of ulcer it is. AS-OCT scans were carried out through same area of corneal infiltration through center of infiltration that correspond to clinical corneal infiltration. Corneal thickness and Infiltrative thickness are measured with caliper tools.[Corneal thickness-one caliper arm on most anterior hyperreflective corneal surface & 2nd arm on hyperreflective endothelium and Infiltrative thickness- 2nd arm on posterior border of hyperreflective area].  CONCLUSION: This study showed the length and depth of infiltrate as significantly lower by SLIT LAMP than ASOCT method however the breadth of the infiltrate measured as higher by SLIT LAMP than ASOCT. The overall corneal thickness measured was also found to be high when measured with ASOCT. ASOCT provides accurate and non-invasive measurements of corneal ulcer depth which is not possible with slit lamp hence it can enhance diagnosis and management of corneal ulcers along with monitoring disease activity. , Non Members, , Dr Prof Pankaj Choudhary, pankaj17choudhary@gmail.com, 9826468847, Shyam Shah Medical College Rewa, Non Members, , Purva Gadoeya, poorvagadoeya@gmail.com, 8770392353, Shyam Shah Medical College Rewa, Non Members, , Garima Dhurve, gdhurve11@gmail.com, 7999190930, Shyam Shah Medical College Rewa, Non Members, , Aditi Kaintura, leelakaintura97@gmail.com, 8826777587, Shyam Shah Medical College Rewa, 2025-03-29 14:26:19]

Initial visual acuity was 6/60 in the right eye and 5/60 in the left eye. Fundus examination revealed multiple whitish fluffy areas of retinitis  slight disc pallor  areas of vasculitis  and a macular star in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed neurosensory macular detachment in both eyes. A provisional diagnosis of post-typhoid bilateral retinitis with star-shaped maculopathy was made. The patient was treated with oral prednisolone at 1 mg/kg body weight  tapering over two months  with follow-up every two weeks.  At the two-month follow-up  the patients best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 6/12 in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed resolving lesions  and OCT showed complete resolution of serous macular detachment in the right eye. The pathophysiology of the condition is likely retinal infiltration  with immune-mediated vasculitis secondary to typhoid infection. Immunological complexes may contribute to damage via homology or molecular mimicry.  This case represents a rare instance of non-infectious  immune-mediated retinitis with stellate maculopathy and macular neurosensory detachment following typhoid fever. Oral steroid treatment led to favorable outcomes. Non-invasive imaging techniques like OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) were crucial for assessing retinal and choroidal involvement  monitoring disease progression  and evaluating the response to treatment. This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and timely treatment in preventing permanent visual impairment., Non Members, , Arushi Mittal, arushi08mittal.am@gmail.com, 9402222246, subharti medical college, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 14:58:45]

It is often associated with systemic autoimmune disorders or infections and can be triggered by surgical trauma. This case study presents a 70-year-old female with a history of phacotrabeculectomy and rheumatoid arthritis  who developed persistent ocular redness and pain. Initial management with corticosteroids and NSAIDs led to transient improvement  but the disease progressed with the formation of a pus-filled nodule and extensive scleral necrosis. Microbiological analysis identified gram-positive cocci  leading to targeted antibiotic therapy. Further complications  including bleb-related endophthalmitis  necessitated surgical intervention with a scleral patch graft. Methotrexate was introduced for systemic immunosuppression. The case underscores the aggressive nature of necrotizing scleritis and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach  including immunosuppressive therapy  antimicrobial treatment  and surgical management  for optimal patient outcomes., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 16:16:47]

Methods : -A prospective study was conducted  over one year involving 75 patients with fresh traumatic globe rupture. Informed consent was obtained.  -Data Collection Demographic history  ocular trauma details  and past medical history recorded.  Visual acuity assessed using Snellen’s chart.  Slit-lamp examination and ultrasound B-scan performed.  Globe repair done under local anesthesia  with three intraocular samples collected for bacterial culture.  Microbiological Analysis Bacteria were cultured and identified using standard protocols.  Antibiotic sensitivity was determined using the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method.  Patients were discharged after two weeks and followed for 12 weeks for signs of endophthalmitis.  Conclusion: Gram-positive cocci  mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis  were the most common isolates. Infection sources included exogenous bacteria and the patient’s ocular flora. Vancomycin  moxifloxacin  gatifloxacin  and ceftazidime were most effective against Gram-positive bacteria  while moxifloxacin  gatifloxacin  ceftazidime  and ciprofloxacin were preferred for Gram-negative bacteria. Delayed primary repair increased the risk of infective endophthalmitis. Vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics led to better outcomes. Understanding bacterial isolates aids in selecting appropriate prophylactic drugs to prevent endophthalmitis.  , DOS Members, A-18, Dr. T.S.

Methods: A single centre prospective interventional study was conducted on radiologically diagnosed >1cm periorbital dermoid cysts of 16 patients.  Ruptured  recurrent  dumbbell  orbital dermoids were excluded. All cases underwent foam sclerotherapy using STS and were followed uptil 6 months. Success was defined as complete disappearance of mass on ultrasonography and inspection. Primary outcome measures were radiological and clinical success rate at 6 months  secondary outcome measures were correlation of preoperative volume with postoperative volume change.  Results: 16 cysts of 16 patients with mean age 7.3 ± 4.9 years and female: male ratio  of 1.2:1 were treated.  Mean preoperative USG volume decreased from 1.04 ± 1.39 ml to 0.38 ± 0.77 ml (p= 0.001) and mean clinical volume decreased from 1.39 ± 1.75 ml to 0.49 ± 0.97 ml (p= 0.001) at 6 months post treatment. Success rate was 12.5% at 3 months and 0% at 6 months. The preoperative volume showed negative correlation with percentage decrease in volume at 6 months both radiologically and clinically (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.77 and 0.84 respectively  p= 0.001). No significant complication was noted.  Conclusion: Foam sclerotherapy with sodium tetradecyl sulphate is a safe procedure but has low success rates in management of periorbital dermoid cysts.  , DOS Members, G-591, DR.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study screening school children of 8-12 years of age  for sub-normal vision and refractive errors in Central Delhi. Vision was tested by trained ophthalmology team using Snellen charts. Risk factor questionnaire was given to all children for completion by their parents. All children with vision <6/9 or wearing spectacles underwent cycloplegic refraction. The prevalence of refractive error  associated risk factors and barriers to refractive correction were analyzed.  Results: A total 1000 urban school children were registered and 984(570 girls & 414 boys) of them participated in study. In study  8.4% (corrected 2.84% and uncorrected 5.58%) of children had refractive errors  with 5.69% having myopia and 2.7% having hypermetropia. All refractive errors were mild to moderate. The prevalence of myopia in girls was higher at 7.9% compared to boys at 2.7%  (p value<0.0001). The prevalence of myopia increased with student’s class grades (p value <0.0001)  longer study hours(p=0.001)  online classes during COVID 19(p<0.001). A positive association of myopia with paternal history of refractive errors was observed (p value <0.001)  Parents educational level(p<0.001) and family income (p value <0.001). A highly significant association was observed between refractive errors and parents/caregiver awareness about refractive correction options (p value <0.0001). A protective effect of outdoor activities on developing refractive errors was observed (p value=0.063).  Conclusion: Refractive error is common cause of visual impairment in Indian school children. Effective strategies should be devised for identifying risk factors  creating awareness about refractive errors and provide cost effective intervention. , DOS Members, S-335, DR.

Retinal vein occlusions are divided into central (CRVO)  hemi (HRVO)  and branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVO). BRVO is a venous occlusion at any branch of the central retinal vein A 35 year old hindu male from Bihar presented in the OPD on with diminution of vision in left eye since 15 days which was sudden in onset and progressive and painless in nature. On dilated fundus examination of left  eye  the arteriolar wall reflex appeared altered in the superotemporal  (ST) quadrant . The affected venule and the involved AV crossing couldn’t be seen due to haemorrhages. Multiple intra retinal hemorrhages were seen in the ST quadrant extending upto the fovea. There were a few scattered hard exudates in foveal and parafoveal area. On slit lamp biomicroscopy with 90 D lens the foveal reflex was blunted with thickening seen in macular area. On OCT  the foveal contour appeared to be blunted. There was prescence of cystoid spaces in inner retinal layers with macular thickness of 528 microns.Outer Plexiform Layer showed hyperreflective lesions with posterior shadowing. Patient’s serum homocysteine levels were raised (37.04 umol/dl). Retinal Vein Occlusions in young patients without classic systemic risk factors may indicate the necessity of a thrombophilic profile evaluation to determine possible cause(s). , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 17:53:57]

Symptoms began shortly after patient had 1.5 litres of water over a span of 2 hour to undergo uroflowmetry as advised by the treating surgeon. On examination he had bilateral elevated IOP. The water drinking test showed a peak intraocular pressure of 55mmHg in right eye and 52 mmHg in left eye on NCT that responded well to oral and topical IOP lowering drugs. Gonioscopy demonstrated open angles and fundus examination showed non glaucomatous optic nerves with no RNFL loss or splinter hemorrhages. conclusion: Water challenge test was thought to supplant the 24-hour IOP monitoring in open & angle closure glaucoma as the rise in IOP correlates well with the peak diurnal variation in a given patient.

Methods: A 29-year-old male patient with a 14-year history of diabetes presented with gradual and progressive diminution of vision in the left eye over a period of six months. On fundus examination  the patient was diagnosed with CSR. The patient was treated with anti-VEGF injections  which are commonly used to treat retinal conditions involving vascular leakage and fluid accumulation. The patient was closely monitored with follow-up visits to assess the reduction in edema and any visual improvements following the treatment.  Conclusion: The administration of anti-VEGF injections demonstrated a significant reduction in retinal edema  leading to improvements in the patients condition. This suggests that anti-VEGF therapy is an effective treatment option for patients with CSR  particularly in those with underlying conditions like diabetes. The case also highlights the importance of monitoring diabetic patients for retinal complications  as they may be more susceptible to conditions such as CSR.

Methods: A 44-year-old female presented with headache  right periorbital pain  progressive bilateral vision loss (right>left)  and right eye proptosis. Examination revealed BCVA of 6/12p (right) and 6/9 (left)  5mm right eye proptosis  restricted extraocular movements in the right eye  and intraocular pressure (32mmHg) in the right eye. Pupil Round regular and reactive in both eyes  Lens clear in both eyes. Fundus within normal limits in both eyes. Comprehensive ophthalmic examination  laboratory investigations  and orbital MRI were performed.Complete Blood count  Serology  Thyroid profile was within normal limits. ESR and CRP was borderline raised.MRI showed bilateral extraocular muscle involvement with predominant right inferior oblique muscle thickening  inflamed retro-orbital fat bilaterally  and hypertrophied right lacrimal gland.   Results: Based on the typical clinical findings and investigations  a clinical diagnosis of Bilateral Idiopathic inflammatory Orbital Syndrome with Asymmetric Myositis and Dacryoadenitis was made. Conclusion: Idiopathic inflammation of the orbit is a non-granulomatous inflammatory process in the orbit or eye in which a local or systemic cause cannot be found. The asymmetric presentation  bilateral tendinous insertion involvement  and adjacent fat infiltration with unilateral proptosis favor idiopathic inflammatory orbital syndrome over Graves orbitopathy. Prompt corticosteroid therapy resulted in symptomatic improvement and visual recovery  though motility restrictions persisted. This atypical bilateral presentation with asymmetric involvement adds to the literature on idiopathic inflammatory orbital syndrome.

The patient was diagnosed with a macular lesion post-vasculitis  compounded by proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection in the management of these ocular conditions.  Method: A comprehensive clinical evaluation was conducted on the patient  including detailed history-taking  visual acuity testing  fundus examination  optical coherence tomography (OCT)  and fluorescein angiography to assess the extent of the macular lesion and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Based on these findings  the patient was advised to undergo sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection  a corticosteroid-based therapy aimed at reducing inflammation and managing the retinal changes associated with both macular lesions and diabetic retinopathy.  Conclusion: The administration of sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection in this case showed promising results in reducing macular edema and controlling inflammation  leading to stabilization of the patients vision. The findings suggest that corticosteroid injections may offer a beneficial treatment option for patients with complex ocular conditions  including macular lesions following vasculitis and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

The aim of this study is to broaden the health importance of pseudoexfoliation by determining whether vascular risk factors and cardiac abnormalities are more with pseudoexfoliation patients than patients without pseudoexfoliation.  Materials and Methods:  This cross-sectional study was conducted among outpatients and inpatients attending.The study includes all patients older than 40 years with pseudoexfoliation and without pseudoexfoliation (controls). Cardiovascular outcomes compared between patients with and without PEX included blood glucose (defined by ADA classification)  cholesterol (defined by WHO classification of cholesterol)  blood pressure (defined by JNC7 blood pressure classification) and cardiac morbidity (defined by ECG abnormalities and echocardiogram).        Conclusion:  Out of all the parameters measured  pseudoexfoliation patients were found to have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and more frequent ECG abnormalities  and changes in echocardiogram but not with higher blood glucose or serum cholesterol . Thus  for patients with pseudoexfoliation we should monitor blood pressure and check cardiac status of the patient., Non Members, , DEEKSHA NARENDRA KAMATH, dnkamath97@gmail.com, 9845646700, MINTO REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF OF OPHTHALMOLOGY  BMCRI BANGALORE, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 20:54:28]

Cataract surgery is the definitive treatment to relieve intraocular pressure (IOP) and restore vision. This study evaluates the clinical outcomes of cataract surgery in patients with phacomorphic glaucoma.  Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted on 10 patients diagnosed with phacomorphic glaucoma who underwent cataract extraction. Preoperative parameters  including IOP (measured using a Schiotz tonometer with a 7.5 g weight)  visual acuity  and anterior chamber depth  were recorded. Postoperative outcomes  including IOP control  visual improvement  and complications  were assessed at one week  one month  and three months.  Results: The preoperative IOP averaged 30.4 mmHg and significantly decreased to 20.6 mmHg postoperatively (p<0.05). Visual acuity improved in 6% of cases  with 4% achieving a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/18 or better. Postoperative complications were observed in 2% of cases  primarily transient corneal edema. No cases of persistent glaucoma were observed at three months.  Conclusion: Cataract surgery in phacomorphic glaucoma effectively reduces IOP and improves visual outcomes. Early intervention and proper perioperative management are crucial in preventing complications and optimizing results., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 20:56:08]

While GDDs are generally effective in controlling IOP  they are associated with several complications that can affect the short-term and long-term success of the surgery. Here  we report 3 cases of corneal decompensation post AGV implantation. Methods : This is a  retrospective case series Results : 3 patients who underwent AGV   on regular followups with controlled IOPs presented with corneal decompensation . The duration of tube implantation and corneal decompensation ranged between 12 - 30 months   with a mean of 24 months. 1 patient underwent DSAEK  . 1 underwent tube repositioning and 1 kept on close followup   Conclusion : Risk factors for developing corneal decompensation include pre-existing endothelial dysfunction  long-standing elevated IOP  and tube placement . In some cases  the tube may be lying too close to the corneal endothelium. Patients present with significant vision loss. Management of corneal decompensation post-tube surgery varies depending on the severity   location and progression of the condition  ranging from conservative measures like hypertonic saline drops and soft contact lenses to surgical interventions such as tube trimming/ repositioning or  penetrating keratoplasty or Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK)/ DSAEK in advanced cases.

Two months postoperatively  corneal graft melting was observed  prompting a therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK). However  following TPK  graft infiltration occurred  and an amniotic membrane graft was performed. Despite these interventions  the corneal graft failed after one month. An ultrasound B-scan revealed retinal detachment  leading to the decision for temporary keratoprosthesis with OPK  vitrectomy  endolaser  and silicone oil injection. At one month postoperatively  the corneal graft was clear  and the retina remained attached with silicone oil in place. Conclusion: In conclusion  the patient underwent multiple complex procedures to address pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and subsequent complications  including corneal graft failure and retinal detachment. Despite initial graft failure and retinal issues  the patient’s condition stabilized with a successful combination of therapeutic interventions  including penetrating keratoplasty  amniotic membrane graft  vitrectomy  and silicone oil injection.

Case 1: A 18-year-old male sustained traumatic globe enucleation due to a road traffic accident. 2.	Case 2: An 11-year-old bilateral blind child received a corneal transplant using the extracted cornea from Case 1. The aim is to emphasize the importance of globe preservation  management of ocular trauma  and corneal donation as a viable solution for restoring vision in patients with corneal blindness. Methods: Case 1: The patient had multiple facial fractures with auto-enucleated right globe found  outside the orbit. Examination revealed extraocular muscle and optic nerve severed  with an unrepairable globe. CT scan confirmed extensive orbital damage. The primary treatment included enucleation  wound repair  and post-operative antibiotic therapy. The excised eyeball’s cornea  was stored in Extrasol medium. Case 2: The recipient had right eye corneal opacity due to prior trauma. His visual acuity was limited to finger counting close to face. Optical penetrating keratoplasty was performed using the preserved cornea. Conclusion: Severe orbital trauma can lead to traumatic enucleation  necessitating immediate management. Timely corneal retrieval enables sight restoration in eligible recipients. This case underscores the significance of eye donation and structured corneal preservation programs in reducing corneal blindness. A multidisciplinary approach  including emergency management  organ retrieval  and transplantation  is crucial for optimizing outcomes. Efforts should be made to raise awareness about eye donation and improve access to quality donor corneal tissue. , DOS Members, D-7235, Dr. JYOTI DESWAL, yoti_deswal@yahoo.co.in, 9416857905, RIO PGIMS  ROHTAK, DOS Members, C-128, DR.

The visual loss was progressive  no history of color desaturation  no pain with ocular movements. Her medical and family history was unremarkable. Visual acuity was finger counting at 1 metre with accurate projection of rays. A swinging flash light test revealed left eye RAPD. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy showed normal anterior segment findings. Direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy showed normal fundus findings in both eyes. The MRI findings suggested opacification of right sphenoid sinus with mild rarefaction of its lateral wall. On MRI correlation  findings likely suggestive of sphenoid sinus mucocele. The patient underwent endoscopic nasal surgery with a midline approach to the left sphenoid sinus  with abundant pus and a sphenoid mucocele removed on opening.  There was improvement in visual acuity post operatively to 6/60 in the left eye. Conclusion : In patients experiencing vision loss due to atypical optic neuritis  isolated sphenoid sinus opacity should not be ignored and must be recognized as an otolaryngological emergency. Prompt conservative management or surgical drainage  when required  can potentially reverse optic neuritis associated with sphenoid sinusitis. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-29 23:30:43]

Methods: A retrospective review of patient records was conducted  including patients who underwent cataract surgery and received either subtenons or subconjunctival anaesthesia. Intraoperative and post-operative pain scores  as recorded in patient charts  were collected. Post-operative complications  including subconjunctival hemorrhage  chemosis  and infection  were also extracted from patient records. Statistical analysis was performed using appropriate tests (e.g.  t-test  chi-square test) to compare pain scores and complication rates between the two anaesthesia groups. Results: The subtenons anaesthesia group demonstrated a trend towards lower mean post-operative pain scores compared to the subconjunctival anaesthesia group  although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). The incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage was observed to be higher in the subconjunctival group (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the rates of chemosis or infection between the two groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In this observational study  subtenons anaesthesia was associated with a trend towards lower post-operative pain and a lower incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage compared to subconjunctival anaesthesia in a rural hospital setting. While both techniques are utilized  these observations suggest potential differences in patient outcomes that warrant further investigation.

Methods:  A 50-year-old male who presented with secondary glaucoma in the left eye following vitreoretinal surgery underwent gonioscopy--assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) for intraocular pressure (IOP) control. At the one-week postoperative follow-up  his Snellen’s visual acuity had declined from 6/36 to 2/60  with an IOP of 4 mm Hg. Gonioscopy revealed a cyclodialysis cleft (CDC) spanning 4 clock hours in the nasal quadrant  accompanied by hypotonic maculopathy and a shallow serous choroidal detachment on fundoscopy and ultrasonography (USG)  respectively. Initial conservative management proved ineffective  necessitating surgical intervention. He subsequently underwent cyclodialysis repair via endocyclopexy using 10-0 prolene combined with endocyclotamponade with a modified capsular tension ring (CTR) in the sulcus. Postoperatively  the CDC had closed with an IOP spike of 33 mm Hg on day 1 and 54 mm Hg at one week  prompting the initiation of antiglaucoma medications. Due to persistent IOP elevation  trabeculectomy was ultimately performed for IOP control. Result: The CDC was successfully closed using a combined ab- interno approach. However  a refractory IOP spike occurred after the CDC repair  necessitating a filtering surgery for effective management. Conclusion: Successful CDC closure via a combined ab-interno approach was followed by refractory IOP elevation  necessitating surgical intervention. In the post-MIGS era  this case underscores the crucial importance of precision in goniotomy incisions to prevent this challenging complication  which remains challenging to manage., DOS Members, PD-2104, Dr. ANAND PATHAK, anandk.pathak95@gmail.com, 8383828055, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS New Delhi, DOS Members, GD-1506, DR.

Methods: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted on 26 CP patients. The birth history  developmental milestones  and complete ophthalmic examination done including slit lamp examination  cycloplegic refraction  fundus evaluation  and axial length (USG B-scan)  were recorded. Neuroimaging CT/MRI (wherever possible) findings were analyzed for associations with ocular abnormalities.  Results: Ocular abnormalities were found in almost all patients  with strabismus (~61%) being most prevalent  followed by refractive errors (~50%)  nystagmus (~28%) and optic atrophy (~3%). Severity of ocular abnormalities correlated with spastic CP (~92%) and mental retardation (~61%). Neuroimaging revealed frequent structural brain abnormalities which might be linked to visual impairment.  Conclusion: Ophthalmic involvement in CP is significant but often overlooked. Early detection and management can improve quality of life. Routine ophthalmic screening should be integral to CP care for timely intervention., Non Members, , DR.

The patient presented with gradual  progressive  painless blurring of vision in both eyes for 2 months. He had undergone phacoemulsification and intra-ocular lens implantation in his right eye 2 years ago and had a good visual recovery (BCVA: 6/6). The visual acuity at presentation was finger counting at 2 metre in right eye and finger counting at 1.5 metre in the left eye. On slit lamp examination  corneal edema and diffuse Descemet’s folds in both the eyes noted with no guttae or intraocular inflammation. Rest of the examination was within normal limits. Pachymetry showed a central corneal thickness of 632 and 598 microns. He was a diagnosed case of Parkinsonism for 9 years and on regular treatment. His medications include  donepezil  emzosin  telmisartan  amantadine (started 2 years back  100mg/day) and clonazepam. He was suspected to have amantadine toxicity. After discussing with the treating physician  amantadine was stopped. He was treated with topical steroids and lubricating eye drops. He has been kept on regular follow-up and has shown improvement. Conclusion: Bilateral corneal edema in patients with parkinsonism should raise a suspicion of an uncommon adverse effect  amantadine toxicity. Patients on systemic medications that have ocular side effects should undergo regular ocular examination to establish baseline and early diagnosis and management.

This study highlights the techniques  intraoperative and postoperative complications  and suggests measures for better aesthetic outcomes.  Methods – 21 eyes (n=21) were included in this retrospective  hospital-based study conducted at an Eastern Indian tertiary care centre from June 2021 to May 2024. Preoperative anterior segment examination also included ocular surface staining  limbus analysis  pachymetry and intraocular pressure. Most eyes (n=18) underwent automated superficial KP  two underwent manual intrastromal KP. One eye underwent combined automated superficial as well as manual intrastromal KP. All but one eye had commercially available India Ink dye used for KP. In one eye  freshly prepared soot was used for manual intrastromal KP. Result – There were twelve males and nine females  aged 18 to 40. The most common preoperative ocular condition seeking cosmesis was post-traumatic corneal opacity (47.6%). Thirteen eyes had satisfactory cosmesis  which was noted in their follow-ups. Concerning complications were intraoperative perforation (n=1)  corneal ulcers (n=2)  immediate fading of dye (n=2)  corneal melt with perforation (n=2)  and endophthalmitis (n=1).  Conclusion – KP is a minimally invasive technique that improves the cosmetic appearance of patients. There was an overall increase in our success rate and reproducibility (33% fading in the first year versus 14% fading in the last year) after retrospective introspection of complications. Encountered complications paved the way for improving the learning curve and identifying ideal candidates for KP , Non Members, , MONA BHARGAVA, drmba@snmail.org, 7003716925, sankara nethralaya   kolkata , Non Members, , ADITI JOHRI, draji@snmail.org, 9455194974, sankara nethralaya   kolkata , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 02:15:04]

A total of 320 eyes from 160 diabetic patients were analyzed in this tertiary care-based cross-sectional study. Patients were classified into No DR  mild NPDR  moderate NPDR  severe NPDR  and PDR  with each group including both DKD and non-DKD patients. Blood investigations  including serum creatinine and urea levels  along with macular vessel density and FAZ measurements  were performed and statistically analyzed.  A progressive decline in vessel density was observed with increasing DR severity. Superficial vessel density (SVD) declined from 41.3% (No DR) to 25.56% (PDR) (p < 0.001)  while deep vessel density (DVD) reduced from 55.08% to 40.09% (p < 0.001). FAZ area significantly increased  from 0.27 mm² to 0.56 mm² (p < 0.001)  reflecting worsening capillary dropout. Patients with higher serum creatinine and urea levels exhibited significantly reduced vessel density and larger FAZ  suggesting a strong link between diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.  OCTA-based assessment provides a valuable biomarker for DR progression and systemic complications. The findings emphasize the need for early screening  glycemic control  and integrated management of diabetes-related microvascular diseases. Routine OCTA evaluation could enhance early intervention strategies for preventing vision loss in diabetic patients., Non Members, , Prof sandeep saxena , sandeepsaxena2020@yahoo.com, 9415160528, KGMU Lucknow , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 02:23:08]

There was a history of trauma by knife while playing 1 month back in the right eye following which he underwent a corneoscleral tear repair. His right eye had nil perception of light. His left eye(LE) had a visual acuity of hand movements.  LE showed exudative anterior segment inflammation with retinal detachment on ultrasound. He was given intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone of 1 gm for 3 days and started on oral steroids  1 mg/kg/day and methotrexate 7.5 mg weekly. Two weeks after oral steroids his visual acuity improved to 2/60. Since there was a slow and inadequate response we decided to start him on tab Cyclosporine 50 mg once a day for 10 days which was increased to twice a day after his complete blood count and liver function test were normal. After 2 weeks of tab Cyclosporine  his vision improved to 6/36. He was continued on tab Cyclosporine and two weekly tapering of oral steroids. After 2 months of treatment  his visual acuity improved to 6/9  N6. Conclusion: We highlight the efficacy of Cyclosporine in paediatric ophthalmia refractory to conventional immunosuppressants and the significance of choosing the right immunosuppressant for better visual recovery.   , DOS Members, J-7240, DR.

This case highlights the clinical presentation  diagnostic approach and management of a patient with this condition  Methods: A 40 year old gentleman presented with white discoloration and deterioration of vision of both eyes for 2 years. His best corrected visual acuity was 6/12 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed bilateral peripheral deep lipid deposition in the corneal stroma with cholesterol crystals and crystalline structures without any neovascularization. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was done to confirm the diagnosis and showed increase in central corneal thickness. On systemic workup  the patient was found to have mild dyslipidemia and left ventricular atrophy.  Results : The patient was started on cholesterol lowering drugs to halt the progression and lubricating eye drops to manage symptoms. The patient is under regular follow-up to monitor disease progression and response to treatment.  Conclusions : Dystrophia adiposa cornea is a rare but significant condition that affects vision and corneal clarity. Early diagnosis and management are crucial for preserving vision and improving patients outcome. This case highlights the importance of recognizing dystrophia adiposa cornea due to its rarity which can be vision threatening., Non Members, , harshita kashyap, Harshitakashyap98@gmail.com, 8527195676, Dr. D.Y Patil Medical College and Hospital  Pimpri  Pune, Non Members, , Kalibo Jakhalu, jakhalu512@gmail.com, 7005008749, Dr. D.Y Patil Medical College and Hospital  Pimpri  Pune, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 06:34:01]

The child presented with gradual progressive bulging and downward displacement of left eye for 15 days. Clinical examination revealed non-axial  non-pulsatile proptosis with inferomedial displacement of the left globe. CECT and MRI orbit revealed a well-defined cystic lesion in the conal region with inferior displacement of left optic nerve and globe. A differential diagnosis of benign cystic lesion or neoplastic aetiology (such as round blue cell tumour) was made. The patient underwent left superior orbitotomy. The cyst ruptured during excision. The cavity was washed with 3% hypertonic saline to mitigate any inflammatory reactions. Complete excision of the cyst walls was achieved. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an orbital hydatid cyst. Postoperatively albendazole was initiated and the patient demonstrated significant improvement during follow-up. Conclusion: The age of presentation and typical characteristics of orbital hydatid cysts— slow-growing  longer history—were notably absent in this case. Instead  the patient exhibited a rapid progression and very short history  which deviates significantly from the usual clinical presentation of orbital hydatid disease. Orbital hydatid cysts should be considered as differential diagnosis in paediatric patients with such atypical presentation.

Misra Medical College and Hospital   near Amausi  Anora Lucknow (UP)-226008, , Physical Poster, Neuro-ophthalmology, Ocular Myasthenia Gravis With Multiple Giant Congenital Melanocytic Nevi    -   Merely A Coincidence, , Introduction (Purpose): Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder. Ocular MG classically present as triad of ptosis  oculomotor paresis  and orbicularis oculi weakness. Congenital melanocytic nevus(CMN) is a benign neoplasm comprising nevomelanocytes. One of the serious complications of Giant CMN is neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM)  a rare syndrome with very few symptomatic cases described in literature. The co-occurrence of Giant congenital melanocytic nevus (GCMN) with MG has never been reported. Case Description (method): A 42-year-old female presented with progressive bilateral ptosis with diplopia for 3 months. General examination showed weakness  fatigue  hyperpigmented lesions over the trunk and limbs  consistent with Giant congenital melanocytic nevus (GCMN). Ocular examination shows restricted in all gazes in both eyes(OU). Visual acuity was 6/6 with normal color vision OU. Anterior segment and dilated posterior segment examination was WNL. Result: Positive ice pack test  neostigmine test  and elevated acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody levels confirms myasthenia gravis. Neuroimaging of the head and orbits were unremarkable. Congenital melanocytic nevus was confirmed by biopsy of skin lesions. MG was initially managed with systemic prednisolone and cholinesterase inhibitor and later shifted to cholinesterase inhibitor and azathioprine for prolonged immunosuppression. Patient responded well with improvement in ptosis and normal extraocular movements after 3 months of treatment. She was kept on monthly followups. Conclusion: This is first case report of a rare association of ocular MG associated with multiple GCMN that responded well to conventional treatment. , DOS Members, S-2134, Dr. RAKESH SHARMA, rakeshsharma1909@gmail.com, 879537477, T.S.

The primary Outcome Vision measure was reduction of inflammatory markers(Interleukin1beta Interleukin 2 Interleukin 4 Interleukin 5 Interleukin 6 Interleukin 8 Interleukin 10 interferon gamma TNF-alpha)in tears and conjunctiva by computer users after three months. Secondary measures include changes in dry eye symptoms score (Schirmer’s test Values TBUT test and goblet cell density in three months)   Results: At the baseline tear inflammatory cytokines and tear film parameters were similar in both the supplement and placebo group. The inflammatory cytokines level showed no significant changes from baseline at three months post intervention in tear supplement group  despite numerical reduction . However the tear supplement group demonstrated a notable improvement in dry eye symptoms ( P< 0.001)   Schirmer’s test score (P<0.001) and TBUT score (P< 0.001 ) .However there was no significant change in conjunctival epithelial cell’s morphology.Additionally there was no substantial increase in goblet cell counts. The placebo group did not exhibit any numerical and statistically significant change in the parameters.  Conclusion: This study indicate that topical installation of Hydroxypropylguar-Hyaluronic acid dual polymer eyedrops neither reduce ocular surface inflammation nor increase conjunctival goblet cell density., DOS Members, J-6425, Dr. SMITI JUYAL, SMITI.JUYAL@GMAIL.COM, 9910231083, GS medical college , DOS Members, BDT-1891, Dr. RAHUL BHARGAVA, BRAHUL2371@GMAIL.COM, 9999055223, GS medical college , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 11:32:11]

Methods: A 29 yrs old male presented with 4 months history of diminution of vision in his left eye. He had history of left eye injury from a wooden particle 4 months ago  which was surgically managed. The best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 1/60 in the left eye. The Intraocular pressure was 10mmHg in the right eye and 4mmHg in the left eye. Anterior segment examination of the left eye showed eccentric pupil with traumatic cataract. Gonioscopy revealed cyclodialysis cleft in the nasal quadrant. Fundus examination showed optic disc oedema with tortuous vessels and choroidal folds. OCT scan showed loss of foveal counter with retinal layers folds suggesting hypotony maculopathy. Patient underwent left eye pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy with cyclodialysis cleft repair. After surgery  the best corrected visual acuity improved to 6/18. The IOP increased to 11 mmHg in the left eye. Two months later  he presented with reappearance of cyclodialysis cleft associated with hypotony maculopathy in the left eye. Patient underwent left eye cyclodialysis cleft repair using the sewing machine technique with oil tamponade. Post surgery  his vision maintained at 6/18 with an IOP of 14 mmHg. OCT scan showed improvement in the maculopathy. Six months later  patient underwent silicon oil removal followed by scleral fixation IOL implantation in the left eye.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted over 8 months in the Departments of Ophthalmology and Obstetrics & Gynecology at S.P. Medical College and Associated P.B.M. Hospitals  Bikaner. A total of 100 pregnant women with HDP (gestational age 24–40 weeks) were examined. Fundus evaluation was performed using direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy after pupillary dilation. Hypertensive retinopathy was graded using Keith-Wagner classification and correlated with clinical parameters such as severity of hypertension  proteinuria  age  and parity.  Results: Out of 100 patients  80% exhibited fundus changes. Grade 1 hypertensive retinopathy was most common (43%)  followed by Grade 2 (32%). Grade 3 and Grade 4 changes were seen in 4% and 1% respectively. Mild preeclampsia was present in 83% and severe preeclampsia in 17% of cases. A statistically significant correlation was observed between severity of hypertension and fundus changes (p=0.0001). Proteinuria also showed a strong correlation with fundus findings (p=0.0001)  while age and gravidity did not show significant associations.  Conclusion: Retinal changes are common in HDP and increase with the severity of hypertension and proteinuria.

This tumor occurs in adults  most commonly between the 3rd and 5th decades of life with infra-medial globe displacement  leading to proptosis. Pleomorphic adenoma is a slow-growing  painless mass that is well-circumscribed and shares similarities with salivary gland neoplasm. Although benign  these tumors have the potential to undergo malignant transformation into pleomorphic adenocarcinoma or cystic carcinoma if left untreated. Case Description (method) We present the case of a 65-year-old female who came in outpatient department and complaints of abnormal outward protrusion of her right eye for the past 3 to 4 years. Upon detailed ocular examination  color Doppler imaging  contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)  fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)  and histopathological analysis  a diagnosis of lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenoma was confirmed.  Result The patient underwent a right eye orbitotomy of the lesion  leading to significant improvement in her symptoms and condition.

Initial visual acuity was 20/40 in the right eye and finger counting at one meter in the left eye. Slit lamp examination revealed pseudophakia in the right eye and a fibrosed lens capsule in the left eye. There was no history of surgery in his left eye. Dilated examination confirmed an empty capsular bag with a fibrosed capsule and normal fundus. Ultrasound findings were anechoic  and anterior segment optical coherence tomography showed an intact lens capsule. The patient underwent intraocular lens implantation (IOL) in the sulcus  resulting in improved visual acuity to 20/32.

This report aims to highlight the diagnostic challenges  clinical features  and effective treatment approach for this uncommon condition  emphasizing the importance of considering HSV as a potential etiology in ulcerative nodular episcleritis cases. Methods This case report describes the clinical evaluation and treatment of a 7-year-old child  presenting with a painless  ulcerated  and inflamed episcleral nodule near the limbus. Initial management with topical antibiotics was unsuccessful  and the condition worsened upon the addition of a topical steroid. Based on clinical suspicion of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection  the patient was prescribed topical acyclovir 3% ointment five times daily while discontinuing the steroid treatment. The patients response was closely monitored with follow-up examinations at 2 days  5 days  and 15 days to assess the reduction in inflammation  nodule size  and ulcer healing. The final outcome was documented one month post-treatment.  Conclusion: This case report highlights ulcerative nodular episcleritis as a rare presentation of presumed herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The successful resolution of the condition with topical acyclovir alone underscores the importance of recognizing HSV as a potential cause of episcleral inflammation  particularly when symptoms worsen with topical steroids and fail to respond to antibiotics.

CASE STUDY Two pediatric patients  both under six months old  presented at the pediatric outpatient department of MD Eye Hospital  Prayagraj  with ocular symptoms  including congenital nystagmus  reduced visual acuity  strabismus  and reduced iris pigmentation. Both exhibited unusually light skin and hair color. Family members also reported symptoms such as easy bruising  frequent nosebleeds (epistaxis)  and gastrointestinal issues like cramping  mucous-laden stools  and bloody stools. Fundus examination revealed a pale or hypopigmented retina with prominent choroidal vessels and foveal hypoplasia. While a consistent family history supported the diagnosis  the absence of a known familial pattern did not exclude HPS. Genetic counseling was conducted for one of the two patients  confirming a diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 4 through the identification of mutations in the HPS4 and SLC24A5 genes. MANAGEMENT Treatment involved correcting refractive errors and using low vision aids and UV-protective sunglasses. Strabismus surgery was considered where necessary. Patients were advised to minimize sun exposure by using protective clothing and sunscreen. Platelet or red blood cell transfusions were recommended in cases of surgery or severe bleeding. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis  genetic counseling  and regular ophthalmologic monitoring are essential for managing visual and systemic complications. Supportive interventions such as low vision aids  UV protection  and surgical corrections for strabismus can improve the quality of life for affected individuals. Additionally  addressing bleeding tendencies and potential pulmonary or gastrointestinal complications through multidisciplinary care is crucial. Genetic counseling plays a key role in early detection and informed family planning  particularly for at-risk individuals. This case study underscores the importance of early recognition  comprehensive management  and genetic evaluation in improving the prognosis and long-term outcomes of patients with HPS. , Non Members, , Prof. Aparajita Chaudhary, dr.aparajita.ald@gmail.com, 7249968836, MLN MEDICAL COLLEGE PRAYAGRAJ  UTTAR PRADESH, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 12:32:57]

By documenting this case  we aim to raise awareness about retrobulbar space-occupying lesions (SOLs)  including orbital tumors  and provide insights into the differential diagnosis and management strategies for similar presentations in clinical practice. Methods A comprehensive clinical evaluation was conducted  including detailed history-taking and a thorough ocular and systemic examination. Exophthalmometry was performed to quantify proptosis. Based on clinical findings  differential diagnoses such as orbital tumors and retrobulbar lesions were considered. Further investigations  including orbital CT/MRI  thyroid function tests were planned.  Conclusion  This case highlights the significance of a systematic approach to chronic  painless unilateral proptosis  which often indicates an underlying orbital pathology. The patients progressive axial proptosis without pain  vision loss  or systemic symptoms strongly suggests a retrobulbar space-occupying lesion (SOL)  possibly an orbital tumor.

Awareness and knowledge of emergent ophthalmic disease may be important for early medical presentation and maximization of visual prognosis in some cases.  Objective  To assess public awareness and knowledge of 4 emergent ophthalmic diseases.  MethodThis cross-sectional study was conducted from decemeber 2024 to January 2025  in the waiting rooms of the outpatient eye department of people’s Hospital bhopal.A written survey was administered to evaluate awareness and knowledge of retinal detachment  acute angle-closure glaucoma  giant cell arteritis  and central retinal artery occlusion. Awareness of each disease was assessed by whether participants knew what the diseases were (yes or no). Knowledge was evaluated by responses to 3 questions for each disease  including 1 question  about basic pathophysiologic features  1 question about basic symptoms  and 1 question about basic treatment options. All English-speaking patients who were physically and cognitively able to fill out the survey without assistance were considered eligible and offered the opportunity to participate during times of survey distribution  237 completed the survey. Demographic information  including age  sex  race  income  and educational level  was collected. Data were assessed from February 1 to 7  2025  Conclusion -Levels of awareness and knowledge of emergent ophthalmic diseases are low. These results indicate a need to educate the public about these acutely vision-threatening entities to ensure early medical presentation  to achieve the best possible visual prognosis  and to preserve quality of life., DOS Members, S-1317, DR.

METHODS: In this hospital based  prospective study  48 eyes of 48 patients were diagnosed with primary angle closure(PAC) or primary angle closure glaucoma(PACG) who had visually significant cataract and a patent peripheral iridotomy. Before surgery  patients understand comprehensive ocular examination including biometry  IOP measurements  keratometry  optic disc evaluation and angle of anterior chamber assessment. Phacoemulsification was performed  followed by evaluation of IOP  ACA widening  VA and AGMs dependency at regular intervals over 12 months period. Success was defined as an IOP less than or equal to 21 mmHg without additional surgical interventions. Results: Postoperative assessments indicated a significant decrease in IOP  with an average reduction of 9.1 ± 3.65 mmHg  representing a 43.5% reduction over six months. The requirement for AGMs significantly decreased from 47 out of 48 patients preoperatively to 2 out of 46 patients postoperatively. ACA width increases in all patients  with no progression in optic disc damage. Visual acuity improved in 87% of participants. Conclusion: Phacoemulsification for PACG patients with patent peripheral iridotomy  effectively managed IOP  minimized AGM dependency  and enhanced visual outcomes. This surgical intervention not only aids in disease control but also reduces the economic impact of continuous glaucoma management  advocating for a vital adjustment in the treatment protocols for angle-closure glaucoma  particularly in populations with higher predisposition., DOS Members, T-240, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Glaucoma, Complex Bleb Complications and Custom Management: A Unique Challenge, , This case describes a 52 year old male with advanced Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma who underwent left trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Despite initial success in controlling IOP  the patient developed complications including a thin  avascular bleb with bleb sweating  necessitating discontinuation of steroids and initiation of autologous serum. But due to conjunctival melt  conjunctival advancement with excision of the preexisting bleb was performed within one month of initial GFS  followed by conjunctival resuturing to address a bleb leak.  Despite these interventions  the bleb leak persisted  requiring additional management. Anterior chamber (AC) reformation was done  and a large-sized bandage contact lens (BCL) was placed to manage the leak and promote healing. However  procuring a large-sized BCL proved difficult  and as a result  a custom-made BCL was fabricated to fit the patients specific needs and facilitate proper healing.  This case highlights the complex nature of managing bleb-related complications after glaucoma surgery  particularly in the setting of mitomycin C use. It underscores the need for careful postoperative monitoring and timely intervention to manage bleb leaks  conjunctival melt  and other potential complications following trabeculectomy or combined surgeries. , DOS Members, GD-2237, Dr. Mehak Gupta, mehakg241@gmail.com, 7982518886, Guru Nanak Eye Centre, DOS Members, SD-1837, Dr. ARSHI SINGH, ARSHISING@HOTMAIL.COM, 9999058430, Guru Nanak Eye Centre, DOS Members, S-335, DR.

The 20-item QIRC questionnaire was administered to 104 spectacle wearers  104 contact lens wearers  and 104 individuals who had undergone refractive surgery (N = 312). These groups were similar for gender  ethnicity  socioeconomic status  and refractive error. The main outcome measure was QIRC overall score (scaled from 0 to 100)  a measure of refractive correction related quality of life. Groups were compared for overall QIRC score and on each question by analysis of variance  adjusted for age  with post hoc significance testing (Sheffé). On average  refractive surgery patients scored significantly better (mean QIRC score 50.2 +/- 6.3  F(2 309) = 15.18  P < .001) than contact lens wearers (46.7 +/- 5.5  post hoc P < .001) who were in turn significantly better than spectacle wearers (44.1 +/- 5.9  post hoc P < .01). .

Methods: A 57-year-old male presented with significant vision decline  pigment epithelial detachment  and cystoid macular edema. Diagnosis was conducted using multimodal imaging techniques (OCT and OCTA). The initial phase included four sequential intravitreal Aflibercept injections followed by focal laser therapy. Brolucizumab injections were later introduced to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Follow-ups spanning seven years assessed both anatomical and functional progress.  Results: The combined therapy delivered significant anatomical improvements  such as resolution of pigment epithelial detachment and stabilization of pachychoroid features. Visual acuity improved from 6/12P to 6/9  and central macular thickness was markedly reduced as seen on OCT. This approach optimized outcomes while reducing intervention frequency  resulting in sustained disease stability.  Conclusion: Overlapping pathologies like PCV and CSC within the pachychoroid spectrum demand innovative  patient-specific approaches. This case underscores the effectiveness of integrating anti-VEGF therapies with focal laser treatment for robust  long-term outcomes.

Based on SD-OCT findings  patients were categorized into two groups: normal VRI and with VRI abnormalities  including epiretinal membrane (ERM)  vitreomacular adhesion (VMA)  vitreomacular traction (VMT). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) were assessed at baseline  at every monthly visit and at 6 months. Treatment outcomes in the form of gain in VA and reduction in CMT were compared at 6 months in the two groups of patients with diabetic macular edema.   Results : 60 eyes of 53 patients with DME were included in the study. At baseline  41 eyes (68.3%) had normal VRI and 19 eyes (31.7%) had VRI abnormalities. In 9 eyes (15%) with VMT  the mean gain in VA was <0.3 Log MAR units and mean reduction in CMT was <100microns which was considered a poor treatment outcome.  Conclusion :  Vitreoretinal interface abnormalities decrease the effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment in diabetic macular edema patients. Presence of vitreomacular traction is associated with poor treatment outcome with lesser reduction in CMT and lesser gain in the visual acuity.  Identifying these abnormalities is crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies and determining whether additional interventions  such as surgical management or corticosteroid therapy  may be beneficial.   , DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 13:18:44]

METHODS: We included 35 patients from each category  patients between 40-60 years of age  with BCVA of 6/12  reliable VFA 24-2/30-2 on Humphrey’s Field Analyser 840  with testing protocol by SITA-Standard strategy. The 6x6 mm OCTA scan was performed at the macula  temporal to the macula  and peripapillary area using the ZEISS CIRRUS 6000. Vascular density (VD)and perfusion (VP) at the superficial vascular plexus were recorded. CONCLUSION: There was a progressive decline in microvasculature at the macula and peripapillary area from normal to early glaucoma patients. Overall  VD proved to be a more stable marker than VP in identifying early changes. Macular VD and VP remained significantly higher than temporal values across all groups. Both superior and inferior quadrants at the macula showed more significant vascular loss. indicating early peripheral microvascular damage. Temporal VD loss appeared early and progressed with disease severity  supporting its utility as a complementary OCTA parameter in the early detection. Impaired retinal microcirculation was seen in Disc suspects and ocular hypertensives  which could be a factor predisposing an eye to neuronal damage. Measuring vascular parameters  such as VD and VP  appears to differentiate between normal  disc suspects  ocular hypertensive  and early glaucoma. Overall  OCTA can play a complementary role in structural OCT imaging and visual field testing to aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma., DOS Members, S-326, Dr. RAMANJIT SIHOTA, rjsihota@gmail.com, 9899806749, SHROFF EYE CENTRE, DOS Members, S-3436, Dr. SWARNALI SEN, swarnalisen@yahoo.co.in, 9871438380, SHROFF EYE CENTRE, DOS Members, K-6097, Dr. SANDEEP KUMAR, guptasandeep.901@gmail.com, 9811811573, SHROFF EYE CENTRE, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 13:23:39]

Previous research papers however  indicated that the general public is not aware of AMD  and there is no information available regarding AMD awareness in India . Therefore  the purpose of our study was to assess the awareness of AMD and its risk factors People’s  University students. Methods -A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire focused on students from the medical  dental  pharmacy business administration  and engineering schools at a people’s university. The interview assessed respondents knowledge of AMD using a standardized questionnaire derived from the AMD AllianceInternational Global Report. Demographic data included age  gender  education level  and home type (ruralvs. urban).ResultsThe 600 students from the People’s  University made up the sample for our study  including 252males (59%) and 248 females (41%). 35% of the total student population— responded that age-related macular degeneration is very common and able-to-detect early  moreover 34% of students responded that macular degeneration is a common cause of irreversible low vision in the world. 16%  18%  18% and 13%believed that smoking  diabetes  high blood pressure  and obesity are risk factors for AMD. When thestudents were asked about the potential symptoms of AMD  the majority of students responded that thepatients low vision was the most signifcant symptom  reaching 253 students  or 42%. When asked about treatments options for AMD  the majority of participants showed low level of knowledge about that.  Conclusion -The sample of students knew very little about AMD. It is necessary to implement educational initiatives to increase public knowledge about AMD., DOS Members, S-1317, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Cataract, A Retrospective Study of Incidence and Probable Cause of Cataract in Younger Adults and Visual Outcomes of Surgery, , Purpose Cataract is a major cause of blindness worldwide  with a higher prevalence in developing countries  especially in India. The onset of cataracts at a younger age  known as presenile cataract  is of concern due to its multifactorial etiology  including genetic  environmental  and behavioral factors. The present study aimed to investigate the factors responsible for presenile cataracts and their visual outcomes in younger adults undergoing cataract surgery. Methods This retrospective study included 292 patients aged 30 to 50 years  who underwent cataract surgery at Shri Ram Murti Smarak Hospital from June 2023 to May 2024. Data on demographic details  cataract type  systemic comorbidities  family history  and risk factors were collected. Visual outcomes were assessed based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) pre- and postoperatively  categorized as good  moderate  or poor. Results The study found that 40.7% of participants achieved good visual outcomes  38.4% had moderate outcomes  and 20.8% had poor outcomes. Factors such as smoking  steroid use  and diabetes mellitus were associated with poorer visual outcomes. The presence of a family history of cataracts and certain systemic comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension were linked to worse postoperative recovery. Conclusion This study highlights the significant impact of systemic comorbidities  lifestyle factors  and family history on the outcomes of cataract surgery in younger adults.

BCVA of RE was HM+ with accurate PR and LE was 6/6. Intraocular pressure (IOP) of the right and left eye  measured using non-contact tonometer (NCT)  was 13mmHg and 17mmHg respectively. Right eye examination revealed Grade 4 RAPD  rest anterior segment examination was normal. Fundus examination showed  massive subretinal exudation and subretinal hemorrhages with telangiectasia in all quadrants. Partial exudative retinal detachment was present. Left eye ocular examination was normal. OCT of RE showed subretinal fluid with exudates. Given the clinical findings and OCT imaging  Coat’s disease was considered.  Conclusion : Coats disease is a rare  idiopathic retinal vascular disorder affecting 0.09 per 100000 individuals  usually unilateral with male preponderance and presents in early childhood. If left untreated  can lead to neovascular glaucoma and phthisis bulbi. The disease is usually localized with slow progression if presents in late childhood and adulthood with majority of patients reaching a stable final visual acuity.

Outcomes were compared with those of patients undergoing cataract surgery without pterygium excision at a tertiary hospital in Bikaner  Rajasthan  India.  Methods  A prospective study was conducted from January 15  2024 to December 15  2024  including 30 patients undergoing cataract surgery with simultaneous pterygium excision and 30 controls undergoing cataract surgery without pterygium excision.  Written informed consent was obtained after explaining the studys nature and potential consequences. All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination  including slit-lamp evaluation  dilated fundus examination  BCVA assessment  manifest refraction (including astigmatism)  and keratometry. These parameters were recorded preoperatively and at one and three months postoperatively.  All patients underwent small-incision cataract surgery (SICS) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Refractive outcomes were assessed by comparing predicted versus achieved refraction.  Results  Patients with larger pterygium encroachment (grade ?2) showed significant deviations from predicted refraction. Higher preoperative corneal astigmatism  which partially regressed postoperatively  contributed to unexpected myopic shifts. Significant correlations were observed between prediction errors and both mean keratometry changes and pterygium size (p < 0.05). Final achieved refraction was significantly more myopic than the targeted refraction (p < 0.05).  Conclusion  Pterygium-induced corneal changes impact refractive predictability in cataract surgery. A thorough preoperative evaluation is crucial  and in advanced cases  a staged surgical approach may be necessary for optimal refractive outcomes.

We studied charts of patients who presented with acute symptomatic PVD and VH between January 2024 and July 2024. Only those with a presenting visual acuity of 6/60 (arbitrarily chosen) or better and who completed a follow up of at least 6 months were included. We looked at the incidence of retinal tear on clinical examination and on ultrawide field imaging.  We found that out of a total of 46 patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria  only 6(13%) had a retinal tear/s   which underwent prompt retinopexy. No retinal detachment was noted in any patients during the follow up of 6 months.  It  therefore  appears that the incidence of retinal tear in the those with acute PVD and only mild-moderate grade VH is much lower than in those with fundus obscuring  dense VH.  Clinical relevance of this study is that it suggests that in non-fundus-obscuring VH  such as mild VH in the posterior vitreous or a small streak-like collection in the inferior subhyaloid recess  followup visits can be planned more judiciously and needless anxiety to the physician and the patient about missing a retinal tear can be reduced., Non Members, , Vipul Singh, vips0503@gmail.com, 9013955228, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals  New Delhi, Non Members, , Barsha Sarma, barsha_sarma@rediffmail.com, 9986060890, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals  New Delhi, DOS Members, BD-1884, DR.

Response to antiVEGF was grouped as  Good outcome: complete regression of disease and growth of retinal vessels till zone 3. Poor outcome: Incomplete regression with persistent avascular retina or recurrence or progression requiring additional laser therapy is determined as treatment failure. Factors associated with treatment failure were explored by multivariate logistic regression analysis  Results: 160 eyes of 80 infants treated with intravitreal Bevacizumab Biosimilar were studied  out of which 87.5%(140) eyes and 12.5%(20) eyes were AROP and TYPE 1 ROP respectively. Good outcome was seen in 50%(80)eyes [47.2%(66)eyes and 70%(14)eyes of AROP  TYPE 1 ROP respectively] and remaining 50%(80)eyes [52.8%(74)eyes and 30%(6)eyes of AROP  TYPE 1 ROP respectively] had poor outcome and needed LASER therapy. Low birth weight  preterm and younger post menstrual age at anti-VEGF therapy and zone of disease are the factors associated with treatment failure.   Conclusion:  Intravitreal Bevacizumab Biosimilar is effective in regression of ROP. However  treatment failure remains concern in infants with high risk factors.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial included 300 patients (150 Ripasudil  150 control). The Ripasudil group received 0.4% eye drops twice daily for one month postoperatively  alongside standard medications. Outcomes included central corneal thickness (CCT)  endothelial cell density (ECD)  IOP  visual acuity  and adverse events over 6 months.  Results: The Ripasudil group showed faster visual recovery at Day 7 (44.5% vs. 35.6%  p<0.001) and Day 14 (63.3% vs. 57.1%  p<0.01)  with comparable outcomes by 6 months. Endothelial cell loss was significantly lower with Ripasudil (0.50 vs. 0.92 cells/day  p<0.05  3.39% vs. 8.10% loss  p<0.05). Early corneal edema reduction was greater in the Ripasudil group (p<0.05)  though long-term differences were nonsignificant. Ripasudil also provided sustained IOP reduction (3.17 ± 1.05 vs. 2.77 ± 1.11 mmHg  p=0.002). Adverse effects included ocular hyperemia (9.3% vs. 1.3%  p=0.002) and reticular edema (4% vs. 0%  p=0.014).  Conclusion: Ripasudil enhances early visual recovery  reduces corneal edema  and preserves endothelial cells post-phacoemulsification  with sustained IOP-lowering effects. Its benefits are most pronounced in the early postoperative period  making it a valuable adjunct for high-risk patients.

Case Presentation A 40-year-old woman experienced a sudden visual loss in her left eye  with hand movement visual acuity. An ophthalmologic evaluation found no apparent cause for the visual impairment. Non-contrast MRI of the brain and orbits was unremarkable. She was started on oral prednisolone(1mg/kg)  leading to a complete visual recovery to 6/6.  Two months later  she presented with a sudden onset of bilateral visual loss (PL-)  accompanied by headaches. Contrast-enhanced MRI suggested mild bilateral optic neuritis. The patient was treated with intravenous pulse steroid for three days followed by oral steroid with tapering doses. Post treatment  she showed mild improvement in her left eye  whereas the right eye remained unresponsive(PL-).She was referred to the Neurology Department at a tertiary care center for further evaluation. A repeat contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits revealed pachymeningeal thickening of the bilateral cavernous sinus walls. Pulse intravenous steroid was administered  resulting in significant visual improvement in the left eye (6/12)  while the right eye remained PL-. Comprehensive systemic investigations were conducted  including CSF- ANA  ENA  ANCA  IgG4  MOG  and NMO  all of which returned negative .

Methods: A randomized controlled trial included 300 patients (150 Ripasudil  150 control). The Ripasudil group received 0.4% eye drops twice daily for one month postoperatively  alongside standard medications. Outcomes included central corneal thickness (CCT)  endothelial cell density (ECD)  IOP  visual acuity  and adverse events over 6 months.  Results: The Ripasudil group showed faster visual recovery at Day 7 (44.5% vs. 35.6%  p<0.001) and Day 14 (63.3% vs. 57.1%  p<0.01)  with comparable outcomes by 6 months. Endothelial cell loss was significantly lower with Ripasudil (0.50 vs. 0.92 cells/day  p<0.05  3.39% vs. 8.10% loss  p<0.05). Early corneal edema reduction was greater in the Ripasudil group (p<0.05)  though long-term differences were nonsignificant. Ripasudil also provided sustained IOP reduction (3.17 ± 1.05 vs. 2.77 ± 1.11 mmHg  p=0.002). Adverse effects included ocular hyperemia (9.3% vs. 1.3%  p=0.002) and reticular edema (4% vs. 0%  p=0.014).  Conclusion: Ripasudil enhances early visual recovery  reduces corneal edema  and preserves endothelial cells post-phacoemulsification  with sustained IOP-lowering effects. Its benefits are most pronounced in the early postoperative period  making it a valuable adjunct for high-risk patients.

The research evaluates postoperative visual improvement  graft clarity  and complications to provide insights into the effectiveness of PK for various corneal pathologies.    Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 10 patients who underwent Penetrating keratoplasty between a period of 6months. Preoperative diagnoses  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  postoperative graft status  and complications were recorded. BCVA improvements were analyzed  and postoperative complications such as graft rejection and intraocular pressure elevation were documented.    Results: The leading indications for penetrating keratoplasty included infectious keratitis (30%)  corneal scarring (20%)  keratoconus (20%)  pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (20%)  and corneal dystrophy (10%). At the final follow-up at 6months  60% of patients exhibited an improvement of at least two Snellen lines in BCVA. Graft clarity was maintained in 80% of cases  with complications such as graft rejection (20%) and increased intraocular pressure (10%) observed.    Conclusion: Penetrating Keratoplasty  remains an effective surgical intervention for restoring vision in patients with severe corneal disease.

This report examines the occupational factors contributing to DED and outlines preventive measures to protect eye health. Methods: 1. Occupational Risk Factors •	Prolonged Screen Use: Extended screen exposure reduces the blink rate  leading to tear film instability and eye strain. •	Mask-Induced Dry Eye: Prolonged use of masks alters airflow patterns  causing ocular irritation and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). •	Dehydration & Shift Work: Irregular work hours and insufficient hydration negatively impact tear production  worsening eye discomfort. 2. Preventive Strategies	 •	Frequent Screen Breaks: Following the 20-20-20 rule and optimizing workstation ergonomics help minimize digital strain. •	Proper Mask Fit & Eye Lubrication: Ensuring a secure mask fit and using artificial tears can reduce irritation caused by airflow changes. Conclusion: DED is a prevalent yet often overlooked issue among healthcare workers. Implementing preventive workplace strategies and promoting awareness can significantly reduce symptoms and enhance ocular comfort and health in medical professionals. , DOS Members, D-7235, Dr. JYOTI DESWAL, jyoti_deswal@yahoo.co.in, 9416857905, RIO PGIMS  ROHTAK, DOS Members, C-128, DR.

This case also highlights the role of systemic vascular factors in addition to raised IOP in retinal occlusive disorders  especially in young patients that can lead to secondary neovascular glaucoma (NVG). Method: A 35-year-old male with JOAG since 2009  post bilateral trabeculectomy (2012-2016)  was lost to follow-up for four years. He presented with poor vision (finger counting) in both eyes  uncontrolled IOP (>40 mmHg)  and glaucomatous optic neuropathy (CDR 0.8  0.9). Unexpectedly  fundus examination revealed neovascularization of the iris (NVI) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with bilateral 360-degree retinal hemorrhages and VH in the left eye  along with sclerosed vessels bilaterally. Vasculitis was suspected  however  systemic workup was negative except for elevated lipid and homocysteine levels.The patient was treated with oral/topical antiglaucoma therapy  right eye trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) and postoperative 5-FU  PRP  and multiple intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Although NVI initially regressed  it later recurred  necessitating additional PRP and anti-VEGF therapy. IOP remained uncontrolled despite transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) in both eyes. The patient is under close monitoring. Conclusion: This case underscores the need for thorough retinal evaluation in JOAG  as unexpected findings like NVI and CRVO indicate underlying vascular pathology. Although vasculitis was suspected  the absence of systemic markers and the presence of CRVO-like features  along with elevated homocysteine and lipid levels  suggest a vascular occlusive etiology. Regular follow-up  systemic evaluation  and retinal examination are crucial to preventing further complications. , DOS Members, , , , , Centre for Sight Eye Institute  Dwarka  Delhi, DOS Members, K-8661, Dr. GAURI KHARE, drgauri.khare@gmail.com, 7355148597, Centre for Sight Eye Institute  Dwarka  Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 14:40:11]

Methods: A 32-year-old male presented with chronic lid swelling and proptosis in the right eye  which had developed over a year. There was no periocular pain. Mild restriction of ocular motility was observed in lateral gaze  but there was no diplopia. On examination  his best-corrected visual acuity was 6/6?Snellen in both eyes. Blood counts and thyroid profile were within normal ranges. His serum IgG4 level was elevated at 152?mg/dL (normal range: 4.8–105?mg/dL).  A contrast-enhanced CT scan (Figure 1) showed a well-defined  homogeneously enhancing mass lesion in the right orbits intraconal space (2 x 1.2 x 2.5 cm)  causing proptosis and indistinct fat planes with the lacrimal gland  globe  and lateral rectus muscle  extending into the pre-septal space. There was no bony erosion. An ultrasound-guided biopsy indicated lymphoproliferative lesions with IgG4-positive plasma cells (Figure 2) and focal sclerosis  suggestive of IgG4-related disease. The lesions decreased in size after oral prednisolone (30 mg) treatment  which was tapered slowly. Six months later  the patient returned with lid swelling and enlarged salivary glands. An FDG PET scan (Figure 3) revealed abnormal metabolic activity in the facial glands  pancreas  and multiple lymph node chains. Conclusion: The cause of IgG4 related disease is currently unknown. Diagnosis is indicated by serum IgG4 levels and confirmed through immunohistochemical analysis of a biopsy from the affected organ. FDG-PET is effective in identifying multisystem involvement but cannot distinguish this condition from malignancy. , DOS Members, BDT-1891, Dr. RAHUL BHARGAVA, BRAHUL2371@GMAIL.COM, 9999055223, GS MEDICAL COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL, DOS Members, , J6425, , , , DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 14:42:41]

Method:  A prospective study will be done on patients with PDR according to early treatement diabeteic retinopathy studies who received Anti-VEGF 3-7days prior preoperatively are followed up after vitrectomy on postop day 1 on 1st week 1st month and 3rd month. Detailed examination which includes detailed ophthalmic evaluation including visual acuity  slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy will be done. B scan ultrasonography  Optical coherence tomography angiography Fundus fluorescein angiography  Fundus photography for documentation done as & when required. Conclusion: Preoperative anti-VEGF therapy  particularly with intravitreal Ranibizumab  as an adjunct to vitrectomy in managing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) has shown promising results. It reduces intraoperative bleeding  improves surgical visibility  and aids in smoother membrane dissection. While 60% of patients experienced visual improvement  with 40% achieving significant gains in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  complications such as vitreous hemorrhage and neovascular glaucoma still occurred. Despite these challenges  the therapy demonstrates its potential to reduce intraoperative complications and improve surgical outcomes. However  issues like increased intraocular pressure and the risk of paradoxical fibrosis highlight the need for careful patient management. Further long-term studies are needed to explore its full potential  especially in patients with comorbidities like chronic kidney disease and hypertension. , Non Members, , DR.HEMALATHA B C, , , MINTO REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF OF OPHTHALMOLOGY  BMCRI BANGALORE, Non Members, , Dr.Shashidhar, , , , Non Members, , Vidhyadevi M, , , , Non Members, , Ravi B, , , , 2025-03-30 15:36:06]

Methods : The case involved a 70-year-old male patient who presented with acute  painless vision loss in the left eye. Examination revealed visual acuity limited to hand movement close to the face and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the affected eye. Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the left eye demonstrated significant findings  including retinal whitening and inner retinal thickening  respectively. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) revealed a reduction in retinal capillary density in both the superficial and deep capillary plexuses. Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography indicated significant carotid artery plaque burden and stenosis. Electroretinography revealed a diminished b-wave. Initial management consisted of ocular massage and intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications. Cardiology and neurology consultations were also recommended. Follow-up examination revealed no improvement in visual acuity. Subsequent fundus photography showed resolution of retinal edema  while fluorescein angiography (FFA) demonstrated delayed perfusion of the retinal vessels.  Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal imaging in the early detection and management of CRAO  promoting timely referrals to specialists and improving patient outcomes.

METHODS: A prospective  hospital-based observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center from January 2024 to January 2025  involving 100 patients. Comprehensive ophthalmological examinations were performed  and ocular injuries were classified using the Birmingham classification. The Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) was calculated for each patient. RESULTS The majority of patients (26%) were in the 21-30 years age group  while those over 60 years made up just 1.5%. Males accounted for 72%  and factory workers (47%) were the largest occupational group. Mechanical injuries constituted 92% of cases  with sharp objects (37%) and road traffic accidents (21%) being the main causes. 12% of the injuries were periocular  and 88% were ocular. Most patients had an OTS score of 5  indicating a favorable prognosis. A significant improvement in vision (p-value = 0.0001) was observed at the three-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that prompt and appropriate management significantly improves visual acuity in patients with ocular trauma.  , DOS Members, A-18, Dr. T.S.

Its highly variable presentation often poses diagnostic challenges  requiring a multidisciplinary approach for accurate diagnosis and effective management. This study aims to describe the clinical presentation  diagnostic methods  and treatment strategies for Goldenhar syndrome  highlighting the importance of early intervention in improving long-term outcomes.  Methods: We present a case of Goldenhar syndrome in a 2.7-year-old male patient who presented with facial asymmetry  preauricular skin tags  and epibulbar dermoids. The patient underwent a thorough ophthalmic and systemic evaluation  including fundus examination and ocular motility assessment. Imaging studies (X-ray and CT scan) were performed to detect vertebral anomalies and assess maxillofacial involvement. Multidisciplinary management was initiated  involving ophthalmology  ENT  and maxillofacial surgery teams. Surgical intervention was performed to excise the epibulbar dermoid and reconstruct facial asymmetry. A review of the literature was also conducted to compare the case findings with previously reported cases and current management protocols.  Conclusion: Goldenhar syndrome  though rare  has significant ocular and systemic implications. Early diagnosis through a comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation is essential for timely intervention. Multidisciplinary management plays a key role in addressing the complex craniofacial and ocular manifestations  leading to better functional and cosmetic outcomes. This case emphasizes the need for collaborative care and highlights the importance of raising awareness about this rare congenital disorder among healthcare professionals., Non Members, , Vijay Kumar Maurya, vijay150597@gmail.com, 8174860934, Motilal Nehru Medical College Manohar Das Eye Hospital RIO Prayagraj, Non Members, , Neda Ahmadi, dr.ahmadi555@gmail.com, 7860010555, Motilal Nehru Medical College Manohar Das Eye Hospital RIO Prayagraj, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 16:12:49]

Methods: 15 individuals with mild to moderate POAG and 15 healthy individuals educated up to primary school  age >40 years  with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ? 6/12 in both eyes were included. Both groups performed a cognitive functioning experiment using a Go/No-Go task. Prefrontal hemodynamic responses were measured in the frontal cortex using a 17-channel fNIRS system. Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) with general linear model (GLM) analysis the study observed activation/deactivation (p<0.05) in prefrontal cortical regions while performing the task for various stimuli contrasts.  Results: In POAG  hyperactivation was observed in the middle frontal sulcus (t=2.34)  between the left superior frontal and middle anterior cingulate gyrus (t=2.21)  and between the superior frontal sulcus and middle anterior cingulate gyrus (t=3.75) for Go vs. rest. For No-Go vs. rest  hyperactivation observed in the middle frontal sulcus (t=2.13) between inferior and superior frontal sulcus (t=2.16). Deactivation was noted in the vertical ramus of the anterior lateral sulcus and middle frontal gyrus (t=-2.16) for Go vs. No-Go. No significant response was seen in healthy individuals. Conclusions: Significant stimulus evoked prefrontal cortical hyperactivity during the performance of Go/No-Go stimuli with more cortical activity for No- Go stimuli in POAG individuals. This suggests that for performing the same cognitive function  there is prefrontal hyperactivity required in POAG individuals while not in healthy individuals reflecting poor cognitive functioning in POAG individuals.    , DOS Members, D-517, Dr. TANUJ DADA, tanujdada@hotmail.com, 9873336315, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences Aiims New Delhi, Non Members, , Dr Rohit Verma, Rohit.aiims@gmail.com, 9868005491, All India Institute of Medical Science New Delhi, DOS Members, A-3897, Dr. DEWANG ANGMO, dewang45@gmail.com, 9810896270, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences Aiims New Delhi, DOS Members, GD-1824, DR.

Methods: A 29-year-old male patient with a 14-year history of diabetes presented with gradual and progressive diminution of vision in the left eye over a period of six months. On fundus examination  the patient was diagnosed with CSR. The patient was treated with anti-VEGF injections  which are commonly used to treat retinal conditions involving vascular leakage and fluid accumulation. The patient was closely monitored with follow-up visits to assess the reduction in edema and any visual improvements following the treatment.  Conclusion: The administration of anti-VEGF injections demonstrated a significant reduction in retinal edema  leading to improvements in the patients condition. This suggests that anti-VEGF therapy is an effective treatment option for patients with CSR  particularly in those with underlying conditions like diabetes. The case also highlights the importance of monitoring diabetic patients for retinal complications  as they may be more susceptible to conditions such as CSR.

Case report: a 38 years old female presented with upper lid retraction  limited upgaze without any diplopia and bilateral abduction limitation. She was a known case of acquired hydrocephalus with VP shunting done 5 months back. On MRI the shunt was malfunctioning. She had dilated lateral  third and fourth ventricles on MRI. No history of seizures or any sensory motor deficit. Patient was referred to rule out papilledema.  On examination: She had a vision of 6/24 and 6/18p in right and left eye respectively. Pupils were mid dilated with light near dissociation. Rest of the anterior segment was unremarkable. There was no deviation in primary position. Upgaze was limited in both eyes symmetrically with abduction and adduction deficit suggestive of horizontal gaze palsy. On fundus examination  there was no papilledema  bilateral intorsion grade 2 was noted. Bells phenomenon was normal. A diagnosis of pretectal syndrome with horizontal gaze palsy was suggested. Conclusion: pretectal syndrome enjoys diverse etiologies. Hydrocephalus has variegated ocular involvement including pretectal syndrome. The horizontal gaze palsy and bilateral intorsion are suggestive of bilateral damage to otolith pathways.

Agarwal Trophy , Retina, To Assess the Role of Statins as an Adjunctive Anti-VEGF Therapy for Clinically Significant Macular Edema (CSME) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, , Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of statin therapy as an adjunctive treatment to anti-VEGF therapy in type 2 diabetic patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and clinically significant macular edema (CSME).  Methods: In this prospective  randomized interventional study  patients were randomized into two groups: Group A received low-dose atorvastatin (10-20 mg)  and Group B received high-dose atorvastatin (30-40 mg). All participants also received three loading doses of intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg) at monthly intervals  followed by pro re nata treatment over six months. Primary outcomes included the number of anti-VEGF injections required  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  and central macular thickness (CMT). Serum VEGF levels were measured at baseline and six months. Results: The mean number of injections over six months was 3.4  with no significant difference between Group A (3.55) and Group B (3.33) (p = 0.24). Group A showed significant improvement in BCVA at both 3 and 6 months  alongside a notable reduction in CMT. In contrast  Group Bs BCVA improvement was only significant at 3 months  with less consistent CMT reduction at 6 months. Serum VEGF levels decreased in Group A but increased in Group B  though these changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Low-dose atorvastatin (10-20 mg) as an adjunct to anti-VEGF therapy resulted in better functional and anatomical outcomes in diabetic patients with CSME compared to high-dose atorvastatin. These findings suggest potential additional benefits of low-dose statins in managing patients with CSME.  , Non Members, ,  Sanjay Bhadada, , , PGIMER  CHANDIGARH, Non Members, , Vishali Gupta, , , PGIMER  Chandigarh, Non Members, , Reema Bansal, , , PGIMER  Chandigarh, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 16:44:59]

It is rare overall  and retinal involvement is even less common  accounting for 2–12% of ocular cases. Exact prevalence is hard to determine due to limited global data and the infrequent occurrence of retinal cysts compared to orbital or optic nerve involvement. Despite its rarity  retinal cysticercosis is a significant cause of preventable blindness in endemic areas. This case presentation discusses a patient with retinal involvement  presenting visual disturbances and a history of consuming undercooked food in an endemic region. Methods- A young male presented with painless diminution of vision for 4 months. The Patient was then evaluated and underwent a fundus examination on which he was found to have a sub-retinal cyst with scolex. Findings were confirmed by B scan. After extensive history taking  the patient was revealed to have a parasitic infection of teanisis a few months back for which he was treated with oral anthelmintics. Neurology review was done and the patient was advised vitreoretinal surgery for the same.  Results – Fundus examination of patient reveals exudative retinal detachment with cyst present. B scan findings confirmed the above findings.

However  it is a pivotal diagnosis to rule out as it is a both sight- and life-threatening condition. We report a case of isolated ON sheath metastasis from BC presenting with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Case presentation: A three woman of age 47 53 and 57 respectively with known metastatic BC presented with painless  progressive vision loss in the left eye. Visual acuity was hand movement with ipsilateral relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundal features suggested CRVO. Atypical rapid resolution of these features led to suspect ON metastasis. Magnetic resonance of the brain showed perineural enhancement of the optic nerves. Vision improved with radiotherapy in all three cases. Conclusion: Isolated ON sheath metastasis from BC is rare and may present with CRVO., DOS Members, SD-2238, Dr. Himani Sharma, himanisharma3101@gmail.com, 8860999380, VMMC & SJH, DOS Members, B-8468, Dr. sneha budania, snehabudaniajpr@gmail.com, 8290756955, VMMC & SJH, DOS Members, SD-2186, Dr. Anu sehrawat, sehrawatanu1996@gmail.com, 8826055036, VMMC &SJH, DOS Members, SD-2188, Dr. SANJANA _, sharmasanjana291@gmail.com, 8800317627, VMMC & SJH, 2025-03-30 16:50:47]

Methods-All patients with simple congenital ptosis who wished to have a surgical correction and opted for Frontalis sling surgery using a silicone rod  performed by a single surgeon utilising Mehta’s modification of the modified Crawford method. A total of 45 eyes of 38 patients were selected. Three groups of different age ranges were made: group 1  0-5 years  group 2  6-18 years  and group 3  >18 years. 15 eyes were taken in each group. The primary outcome was Marginal Reflex Distance (MRD1)  which was measured at various intervals of Pre- operative and post-operative period were compared between different age groups. The outcomes of Frontalis sling surgery  as measured by MRD1  were categorised into excellent  good  and poor. Most patients had good outcomes at all follow-up intervals. Results-There was lack of significant differences in MRD1 outcomes across age groups suggests that Frontalis sling surgery is equally effective regardless of the patient’s age. This aligns with the broader literature  which generally supports the efficacy of Frontalis sling surgery in various age groups. Conclusion- Frontalis sling surgery remains a reliable option for managing simple congestion ptosis  with favourable outcomes regardless of age. , DOS Members, ND-2210, Dr. GRISILDA NONGREM, GRISIL7REM@GMAIL.COM, 9362307288, VMMV , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 16:54:30]

It is rare overall  and retinal involvement is even less common  accounting for 2–12% of ocular cases. Exact prevalence is hard to determine due to limited global data and the infrequent occurrence of retinal cysts compared to orbital or optic nerve involvement. Despite its rarity  retinal cysticercosis is a significant cause of preventable blindness in endemic areas. This case presentation discusses a patient with retinal involvement  presenting visual disturbances and a history of consuming undercooked food in an endemic region. Methods- A young male presented with painless diminution of vision for 4 months. The Patient was then evaluated and underwent a fundus examination on which he was found to have a sub-retinal cyst with scolex. Findings were confirmed by B scan. After extensive history taking  the patient was revealed to have a parasitic infection of teanisis a few months back for which he was treated with oral anthelmintics. Neurology review was done and the patient was advised vitreoretinal surgery for the same.  Results – Fundus examination of patient reveals exudative retinal detachment with cyst present. B scan findings confirmed the above findings.

METHOD: A single-center  12-month prospective observational study included 65 children (ages 6-14) with progressive myopia (SE -1.00 D to -6.00 D and progression ? -0.5 D in the preceding year). They were prescribed 0.01% atropine eye drops and followed up at 3  6  and 12 months. RESULTS: Out of 65 children prescribed LDA drops  47 (72.31%) were compliant  while 18 (27.69%) were non-compliant after 12 months. Of the non-compliant  16 (88.89%) discontinued within the first 6 months  and 2 (11.11%) stopped at 9 months. Most children (71.64%) had at least one myopic parent. The efficacy of low-dose atropine (LDA)  assessed by refractive error and axial length progression  was found to be 64%  if compliant patients were included  and it dropped to 46% when the total patients recruited was considered. 36% of children were "poor responders " progressing by >0.5 D despite treatment. None discontinued due to side effects. CONCLUSION: In clinical practice  20% of patients may be non-compliant with atropine eye drops  with the highest rate occurring in the first 6 months. Effective counseling  reinforcement  and regular follow-ups during this period can help identify non-compliant patients and guide them to more suitable myopia control methods. , DOS Members, SD-1458, DR.

Elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels have been implicated in endothelial dysfunction  oxidative stress  and vascular inflammation contributing to HR. This study aims to evaluate the association between SUA concentration and HR.  Methods  This prospective cross sectional study conducted from march 2024 to January 2025 included 160 subjects with hypertension in Bikaner  Rajasthan. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A (n=120) with HR and Group B (n=40) without HR. SUA levels were measured  and retinal changes were graded by ophthalmoscopic fundus examination and classified with Keith-Wagener-Barker (KWB) system. The correlation of SUA levels with HR in terms of prevalence and severity was evaluated by statistical analysis. Results analysed as tables  proportions in case of qualitative data  mean and standard deviation in case of quantitative data. p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results  The mean SUA was significantly higher in Group A (6.8 ± 1.2 mg/dL) compared to Group B (5.4 ± 1.0 mg/dL) (p<0.01). A positive correlation was found between SUA levels and the severity of HR (r=0.42  p<0.01). Patients with grade III and IV HR had significantly higher SUA levels compared to those with grade I and II (p<0.05). Conclusion  Elevated SUA levels are associated with the presence and severity of HR. Uric acid may serve as  potential biomarker for vascular damage in hypertensive patients  emphasizing the need for its monitoring in individuals at risk of HR.  , DOS Members, K-4745, DR.

Therefore  surgical therapy for aphakia continues to be contentious and difficult. Therefore the objective of this review was to compare the outcomes of anterior chamber and retropupillary implantation of iris-claw Artisan intraocular lenses (IOL). Methodology: There are several ways to treat aphakia in individuals who have had complex surgery or a history of trauma. The surgical technique used depends on a number of variables  including the iriss health and capsular support. The optimum option for intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is ciliary sulcus implantation  provided that there is sufficient capsular support. However  capsular support is typically lacking in aphakia instances resulting from trauma or complex surgery. In addition to giving a thorough explanation of implantation of the iris claw intraocular lenses. & its related issues  this review article focusses regarding the outcomes of anterior chamber and retropupillary implantation of iris-claw intraocular lenses.  Conclusion: Anterior implantation is simpler than retropupillary implantation  notwithstanding the possibility of endothelial contact in shallow anterior chambers. Permanently raising the IOP is uncommon in both cases. Accordingly  this study proposes that Artisan IOL implantation  both anterior and retropupillary  is a time-saving surgical procedure that is comfortable to use and successful in improving vision.  , Non Members, , DR SACHIN DAIGAVANE, drsachin391977@gmail.com, 9021736568, DATTA MEGHE INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, Non Members, , DR ARCHANA R THOOL, drarchana8030@gmail.com, 7743887667, DATTA MEGHE INSTITUTE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 17:31:51]

One of the key ocular manifestations of Marfan’s syndrome is ectopia lentis  which refers to the displacement or dislocation of the crystalline lens. This case report focuses on the ophthalmic perspective of a patient with Marfan’s syndrome presenting with bilateral ectopia lentis.  *Methods:* A 9-year-old male patient presented to the ophthalmology clinic with complaints of blurred vision and frequent changes in his prescription glasses. His medical history revealed tall stature  arachnodactyly  and a family history of Marfan’s syndrome. A comprehensive ophthalmic examination  including slit-lamp biomicroscopy  fundoscopy  and ocular ultrasonography  was performed. Lens dislocation was confirmed  and systemic evaluation for Marfan’s syndrome was initiated. Genetic testing was conducted to confirm the diagnosis.  Results: The ophthalmic evaluation revealed bilateral superior lens subluxation  myopia  and no evidence of retinal detachment or glaucoma. The genetic test confirmed the presence of a mutation in the FBN1 gene  confirming the diagnosis of Marfan’s syndrome. The patient was educated about the potential visual risks associated with lens dislocation  including retinal detachment and glaucoma  and was advised on appropriate follow-up.  Conclusion: Bilateral ectopia lentis is a significant ocular manifestation of Marfan’s syndrome  and early detection is crucial for preventing severe complications. Ophthalmologists play a pivotal role in diagnosing and managing ocular findings in Marfan’s syndrome  ensuring timely interventions and appropriate surveillance. This case emphasizes the importance of genetic testing and multidisciplinary care for optimal management of the condition. Regular monitoring is essential to detect and address potential visual complications  thus improving the patient’s quality of life., Non Members, , Vijay Kumar Maurya, vijay150597@gmail.com, 8174860934, Motilal Nehru Medical College Manohar Das Eye Hospital RIO Prayagraj, Non Members, , Devansh Kansal, devanshkansal343@gmail.com, 8077347892, Motilal Nehru Medical College Manohar Das Eye Hospital RIO Prayagraj, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 17:47:29]

In another case  23 year old female presented with headache and diminution of vision with BCVA of 6/9.On dilated fundus examination  there was bilateral disc edema with CME with bony spicules in periphery suggestive of RP. It is very rare to see optic disc edema in RP cases  which may occur secondary to rapid degeneration of photoreceptor cells leading to optic nerve inflammation. OCT showed CME with B/L increased RNFL thickness. Conclusion: Retinitis pigmentosa is many times a spot diagnosis  but not always. We should always keep the probability of other variants of RP as well as pseudo retinitis pigmentosa. , DOS Members, N-435, Dr. MANISHA NADA, manisha_nada@rediffmail.com, 9896007158, , DOS Members, P-3743, DR.

Method: This prospective observational study included 37 patients of traumatic cataract planned for cataract surgery between January 2024 and December 2024. Preoperative assessment included a complete ophthalmic examination. B-scan ultrasound was done in all patients with a 5-9MHz linear frequency probe on SonoScape P20 ultrasound system to evaluate the posterior segment. Statistical analysis was performed using the Students t-test to compare the postoperative BCVA outcomes between patients with normal and abnormal posterior segment pathology. Postoperative follow-up was conducted at one week and one month  including visual acuity assessment and refractive correction.  Results: Majority of patients (54.1%) were of 6-10 years age group. Male to female ratio was 1.64:1. Among 37 patients  following posterior segment pathologies were noted in 11(29.7%) patients  Retinal Detachment (n=5)  Vitreous Hemorrhage (n=2)  Intraocular Foreign Body (n=1)  Posterior Vitreous Detachment (n=2)   Posterior Staphyloma (n=1)  in which at 1 month follow up  BCVA ranged from perception of light (PL+) with inaccurate projection of rays to less than 6/60. In 26 (70.2%) patients with normal posterior segment  BCVA ranged from 6/60 to 6/6  attributable to pathology of anterior segment and surgical complications.  Conclusion: This study elucidates the spectrum of ocular changes in traumatic cataract patients on USG B-Scan  which are likely to influence the visual outcome and assist in modifying the plan of surgery.   , DOS Members, K-4745, DR.

He underwent trabeculectomy in the LE at age 8 and lost vision in the RE by age 10 (no records).  On examination  the RE exhibited anterior staphyloma with nearly 360-degree circumcorneal involvement. The LE showed a raised bleb  corectopia with sluggish pupillary reaction  a stretch hole in the iris adjacent to the bleb  Haab’s striae  and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) at 5 o’clock. Bilateral optic atrophy was noted. Intraocular pressure (IOP) by non-contact tonometry (NCT) was 44 mmHg in the RE and 15 mmHg in the LE  with an applanation tonometry (AT) reading of 16 mmHg in the LE under treatment. He was on e/d Dorzolamide and e/d Brimonidine + Timolol  administered thrice daily in the LE.  This case underscores the devastating impact of congenital glaucoma  leading to irreversible blindness despite early surgical intervention. The presence of bilateral optic atrophy and advanced structural changes highlights the need for vigilant disease monitoring and optimized management. Early screening and proactive treatment strategies are crucial in reducing vision loss in at-risk populations. Greater awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential to ensure timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.  , DOS Members, S-3578, Dr. ZIYA SIDDIQUI, drziyaophth@rediffmail.com, 9756604641, Institute of Ophthalmology  Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College  Aligarh Muslim University, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 18:26:48]

Primary outcome assessed was utilization rate across different keratoplasties. Secondary outcomes included records of endothelial cell density (ECD) of donor tissue. Records of outcomes of endothelial keratoplasty using such corneas in the form of post-operative recorded visual acuity  graft clarity  post-operative ECD  signs of graft infection  and failure were evaluated. Results: Out of 333 donor corneas  75.68% were suitable for transplantation  21.3% were allocated for research  and 3% were unfit. Among transplantable corneas  42.04% were used for optical PK  15.9% for DSAEK  9.9% for therapeutic PK  4.5% for DALK  1.5% for patch grafts  1.2% for tectonic PK  and 0.3% each in DMEK & TILK. Mean ECD for endothelial keratoplasty suitable corneas was 2633 ± 291 cells/mm². Minimum 6 months follow-up records of endothelial keratoplasty showed that 91% achieved BCVA ?6/18 & ?6/12 in 60%. Maximum follow-up period was 4 years. Mean ECD declined to 1857.02 ± 133.11 cells/mm² (p<0.0001). Graft rejection recorded in 13.34%  elevated IOP in 18% & graft infections in none. Conclusion: Properly screened corneas with DRT >12 hours lead to successful endothelial keratoplasty outcomes. Traditional DRT limits should be re-evaluated especially in regions with shortage of donor cornea. Preservation quality  ECD  and preoperative assessment are critical.  , DOS Members, J-4251, DR.

To assess the factors affecting visual outcome of cataract surgery in diabetic patients. Methods:  study was prospective observational to evaluate the influence of diabetes on anterior segment of eye with particular focus on the visual outcome after cataract surgery . A comprehensive review of clinical studies and patient data was conducted to analyse anterior segment changes in diabetic patients such as corneal endothelial dysfunction increased inflammation and delayed wound healing. The study also compared post-operative complications and visual outcome in diabetic versus non diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery considering factors like best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  postoperative edema and incidence of diabetic macular edema (DME). Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus significantly affects the anterior segment of the eye  contributing to corneal abnormalities  increased surgical risk and potential delays in visual recovery after cataract surgery. While modern surgical techniques and meticulous perioparative management can optimize outcome  diabetic patients remain at higher risk for suboptimal visual recovery due to associated complications sach as persistent corneal edema posterior capsular opacification and diabetic retinopathy progression.

For time immemorial snellen’s have been “the tool” for recording vision via the white pandora’s box giving so much information in so less off time but with digitalization taking shape   snellen’s failed to keep pace with it and thus digital vision charts took the command overcoming its all shortcomings marking the transition from snellen’s  to digital world  charts.  Clinically more superior  accurate and reproducible than snellen’s   Bailey and lovie Chart and its modified version ETDRS chart  and logMar charts nailed the test of time with optotype being represented on a geometric scale ranging from 6/60 or  20/200 = logMar +1.00  to 6/6 or 20/20 = logMar +0.00  subtending a visual angle of 5 mins of arc at nodal point of eye at their respective distance . Snellen’s even became a hurdle for vision testing in people not knowing roman numerals and alphabets so digital charts like landolt’s c and tumbling E came into picture.  Kay picture charts in a playful environment became the testing tool in preschool kids to eliminate language barrier problems. Talking about vision   so colors can’t take a back seat and thus  we have Contrast sensitivity charts like Pelli Robson contrast and Cambridge contrast sensitivity wherein letter or bars with graded color contrast are used . Color charts like Ishihara for  red green anomalies and hary rand ritler for yellow blue anomalies have helped to diagnose spectrum of color vision defects.  Conclusion: snellen’s  may not be the gold standard when measuring visual acuity in different setups but it is the first investigation of choice ALWAYS even in the digital world .  , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 18:34:59]

Methods: 32 patients were included with 16 patients of POAG and 16 age-matched PACG patients presenting with age-related cataract and planned for phacoemulsification surgery. All patients underwent AA with 0.1% indocyanine green dye injected into the anterior chamber  followed by capture of images upto 60seconds using flex module of OCT. Image J software was used to calculate mean gray value for angiographic signal intensity(ASI) along the limbus into eight sectors(45?each) four quadrants(90?each) and overall flow(360?) for POAG & PACG. Correlation of age and severity of disease with overall flow was evaluated.  Results: The mean age (years) was 58.8 ± 5.8 (POAG) and 59.8 ± 8.6 (PACG)[P=0.704]. No significant difference in the visual field defect with MD(dB) [(-16.79?8.73) in POAG and (-16.39?9.57) in PACG P=0.904]  and VFI (%) [34(25-79.75)] in POAG and [50(17-78.5)] in PACG P=0.777. Overall flow was decreased in PACG [123.72(105.18-205.68)] compared to POAG [188.32(163.58-234.40)] P=0.029. All quadrants showed lower flow in PACG compared to POAG however  this difference was statistically significant in superior quadrant [POAG: 57.41(37.33-68.1)  PACG: 30.55(25.86-52.42) P=0.016] and inferior quadrant [POAG: 35.25(27.68-44.47) PACG: 26.9(23.29-28.96) P=0.022] only. Statistically significant positive correlation of MD (r=0.515 P=0.044) and VFI (r=0.581 P=0.020) with overall flow was seen in PACG and not in POAG patients.  Conclusion: PACG eyes had lower functional AHO compared to POAG  which correlated with disease severity. This study has implications for trabecular MIGS in PACG and may predict worse outcomes in PACG compared to POAG.   , DOS Members, P-8257, Dr. ANUJA PATIL, anujapatil28@gmail.com, 8878764988, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS New Delhi, DOS Members, S-7821, Dr. Ekta Shaw, d.ektashaw@gmail.com, 8240551491, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS New Delhi, DOS Members, A-3897, Dr. DEWANG ANGMO, dewang45@gmail.com, 9810896270, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS New Delhi, DOS Members, D-517, Dr. TANUJ DADA, tanujdada@hotmail.com, 9873336315, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS New Delhi, 2025-03-30 18:48:29]

Methods:A 31-year-old male presented with floaters and painless intermittent blurring of vision in right eye for seven months. He had history of episodes of intermittent headache in childhood. Fundoscopy revealed arteriovenous dilatation and tortuosity in vessels originating from optic disc  involving superotemporal arcade indicative of retinal vascular telangiectasia. Intra-retinal exudates around abnormal vessels with surrounding localised cuff of sub-retinal fluid and focal organised vitreous-haemorrhage extending for 2 clock hours  was present. A conjunctival nevus (4mmx3 mm) was noticed and a multisystem assessment-including dermatology  neurology  radiology was conducted. Dermatological assessment revealed hyperpigmented plaque with hypertrichosis over left hip and erythematous macules over left forearm since birth. Imaging (CT/MR-angiography) confirmed racemose AVM consistent with Wyburn-Mason Syndrome (Group II Archer Classification). Patient underwent Laser Barrage (Double frequency Nd:Yag laser) to prevent further hemorrhages and received topical steroids and lubricants.  Results:Laser therapy stabilized retinal vasculature  reduction in vitreous hemorrhage and improvement in visual symptoms. No neurological symptoms were detected  ruling out life-threatening intracranial complications. Close monitoring was advised due to risk of recurrent vitreous hemorrhages and retinal detachment.  Conclusion: This case serves as a powerful reminder that subtle ocular signs can hint at a rare yet dangerous systemic condition. Wyburn-Mason Syndrome demands a high index of suspicion and a multidisciplinary approach to prevent vision and life-threatening complications. , DOS Members, D-1814, DR.

Methods:  A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 patients presenting with anterior uveitis at Santosh Hospital from June 2022 to May 2023. Patients were evaluated using a stepwise approach  including detailed history  systemic examination  and slit-lamp assessment (e.g.  ciliary injection  hypopyon  posterior synechiae). Inclusion criteria covered all anterior uveitis cases  while posterior uveitis and post-surgical cases were excluded.    Results:  The highest incidence occurred in the **21–30 age group (40%)**  with male predominance (**61%**). Acute iridocyclitis (**72%**) was the most common presentation  followed by chronic (**20%**) and recurrent (**8%**) cases. Idiopathic etiology topped the causes. Major complications included persistent posterior synechiae (**25.89%**) and cataract (**17.85%**). Findings aligned with global trends but highlighted regional specifics.    Conclusion:  Anterior uveitis in Delhi-NCR predominantly affects young males  with idiopathic cases being most frequent. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to preventing vision-threatening complications. Regional epidemiological studies can optimize clinical protocols and improve outcomes.   , DOS Members, B-943, DR.

He was already on Anti Tubercular Therapy (ATT) and oral steroids for choroidal tuberculoma for the past 2 months. His best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and  6/12 in his left eye. RE was essentially normal. LE Fundus evaluation showed subretinal fluid involving the fovea and an inferior macular yellowish subretinal lesion. Inferior fundus also showed yellowish granular deposition along the vessels.  On a detailed re-evaluation of his previous ocular history and imaging  it became amply evident that his diagnosis needed to be revised to Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) with fibrin  which was further iatrogenically worsened by oral steroids. The fibrin deposition along the retinal vessels  however  was very unusual indeed and did mimic frosted branch angiitis. The subretinal fluid  fibrin and unusual vascular fundings resolved over the course of the next few months without any active intervention  apart from cessation of oral steroids. He chose to complete his ATT. His final BSCVA in the left eye was 6/9.  This case  apart from highlighting the caution that is required before starting oral steroid and ATT  also documents an unusual presentation of CSC in the retina  which was mimic frosted branch angiitis., Non Members, , Vipul Singh, vips0503@gmail.com, 9013955228, Sharo Sight Eye Hospitals  New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 18:58:07]

Method- Cataract surgery is a commonly performed procedure to restore vision in patients with cataracts. However  complications such as posterior capsule tear (PCT) can significantly challenge the surgical outcome  requiring careful management. Traumatic posterior capsule tear occurs when the thin membrane at the back of the lens capsule is inadvertently ruptured  potentially leading to vitreous loss  lens instability  and increased risk of endophthalmitis and complicating the cataract surgery management. In these cases  a modified surgical approach is essential to minimize complications and optimize visual recovery. The management of PCT includes techniques such as anterior vitrectomy  the use of intraocular lens (IOL) in the sulcus  or iris-fixated IOLs in cases where posterior capsule support is compromised. Additionally  the choice of surgical instrumentation  the timing of intervention  and post-operative care protocols play crucial roles in ensuring a favorable outcome. Conclusion - This case series reviews the current strategies for managing cataract surgery in patients with posterior capsule tears  highlights recent advancements in surgical techniques  and underscores the importance of individualized care to reduce the risks of visual impairment and other complications., Non Members, , Dr. Jitender Phogat , drjitenderphogat@gmail.com, 9813588757, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  PGIMS Rohtak , Non Members, , Dr Manisha Nada, manisha_nada@rediffmail.com, 9896007158, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  PGIMS Rohtak , Non Members, , Dr Mamta Verma , drmsverma24@gmail.com, 9306355472, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  PGIMS Rohtak , Non Members, , Dr Kritika Jain , dr.kritikajain2016@gmail.com, +91 76965 96977, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  PGIMS Rohtak , 2025-03-30 19:01:17]

She had a history of viral fever one week prior and a long-term history of atopy. Additionally  she was treated for post-viral seronegative arthritis for one month five years ago. On examination  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/6 (-6.00 DS) in the right eye (RE) and 6/6p (-6.50 DS) in the left eye (LE). Anterior segment examination was unremarkable bilaterally. Fundus evaluation of the LE revealed an active hypopigmented choroidal lesion  half-disc diameter in size  inferonasal to the fovea  involving the macula. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed choroidal thickening  and OCTA confirmed choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Extensive investigations yielded no underlying cause. The patient was managed with oral Prednisolone (40 mg OD) and two doses of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. CNV regressed after the first dose  with ongoing symptomatic improvement. Contrast sensitivity has increased  and metamorphopsia has reduced  shifting further away from the macula. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of idiopathic CNV. The association with recent viral illness  atopy  and choroidal thickening suggests a possible inflammatory/ immunological component.

Method- Non penetrating trauma to the eye  whether its ocular  orbital or systemic  may cause a variety of posterior segment abnormalities. Blunt ocular trauma may cause damage to the retina (commotio retinae)  retinal pigment epithelium (retinal pigment epithelial edema)  choroid (choroidal rupture) and optic nerve (optic nerve evulsion) alone or in combination. Traumatic macular holes and retinal detachment or dialysis may also occur after blunt ocular trauma. Trauma to the orbital tissues adjacent to the globe can cause concussive forces with damage to multiple structures within the eye. Systemic trauma may result in diffuse retinopathy (Purtschers retinopathy  shaken baby syndrome) or localized retinal abnormalities (whiplash retinopathy  fat embolism syndrome). Alterations in intravascular (Valsalva retinopathy) or intracranial pressure (Tersons syndrome) due to a variety of causes may result in preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage and associated visual loss. Conclusion -  Timely diagnosis  interventions  and expertise in vitreo-retina play a key role in the management and visual rehabilitation in cases of posterior segment ocular trauma. , Non Members, , Dr. Sonam Gill , sg1268@gmail.com, 9306438895, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  PGIMS Rohtak , Non Members, , Dr Nishant Khare , nkharee@gmail.com, 8004970808, ESIC Medical College and hospital  Faridabad , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 19:15:47]

These rare injuries are not commonly encountered by many ophthalmologists  adding complexity to treatment.  In this case  a 32-year-old male sustained a fish hook injury to his right lower eyelid  with a 4-pronged  barbed hook measuring 6 cm embedded approximately 4 mm from the inferior puncta. The line was cut before presentation  and the patient retained normal vision (6/6)  with no signs of intraocular involvement. X-ray imaging confirmed the hooks location in the soft tissues of the eyelid.  The removal of the hook was complicated by the barb’s resistance to being pulled through the entry wound. Under local anesthesia  the surgical team employed a "Cut-Out" technique  carefully cutting around the barb to release it. The wound was then closed with a 6-0 Vicryl suture.  This case highlights the importance of understanding the types of fish hooks and recognizing that standard management techniques like "Advance and Cut" may not always be feasible. In such cases  employing creative approaches  such as combining techniques  is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes. Proper imaging  surgical adaptability  and post-operative care are key to preventing complications and ensuring functional and cosmetic recovery., Non Members, , Dr Aveena P Kalal, aveenak98@gmail.com, 8095838375, Minto Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  Bangalore, Non Members, , Dr Meenakshi , meenakshi.tb@gmail.com, 9591149584, Minto Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  Bangalore, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 19:18:54]

Patient had a history of trauma in childhood for which he underwent cataract surgery. He developed a Giant retinal tear in his right eye in 2019 for which he underwent multiple surgeries elsewhere. He presented to us with a macula on 6 clock hour GRT with a dropped IOL. Meticulous 25g pars plana vitrectomy with base shaving was done  and to our surprise  there was remnant lens matter stuck at the vitreous base inferiorly. IOL was freed from vitreous attachment  and vitrectomy was completed. IOL was removed via a scleral tunnel. PFCL was injected to flatten GRT edge  and 360 degree endo laser was done with 6-7 rows of photocoagulation. An inferior iridotomy was made  and a direct PFCL-Silicon oil  exchange (Sio  1000Cst) was done. Patient developed uncontrollable raised IOP in post op period and underwent an early SOR at 1 month. Patient is maintaining BCVA of 6/60 and IOP is well controlled. GRT with dropped lens/IOL is a challenging situation and managing post op raised IOP is difficult in such patients.

Seeing no response on follow up  local steroids in form of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide 2mg/0.05ml and trans septal triamcinolone 40mg/1ml was injected. However  on observing worsening or no improvement  they were shifted to Tab Methyl prednisolone 16mg BD.  Results On 2 weekly follow up  both patients had dramatically improved with improvement in visual acuity and resolution of sub retinal fluid and RPE undulations. Methyl prednisolone was tapered on 2 weekly basis.  Conclusion Oral methyl prednisolone led to resolution of VKH in patients not responding to oral prednisolone.  Oral methyl prednisolone can be considered in VKH cases not responding to oral Prednisolone. It can be used as an alternative to steroid sparing agents such as cyclophosphamide and rituximab.

The study aims to explore the predisposing factors  diagnostic challenges  and management strategies for this uncommon fungal infection.    Methods:  A 65-year-old male presented with pain  redness  watering  and diminished vision for one month. Slit-lamp examination revealed a central corneal ulcer with satellite lesions and hypopyon. Corneal scrapings were subjected to KOH mount  Gram stain  and culture on Sabouraud agar  which confirmed Acremonium species. Empirical therapy with topical natamycin  moxifloxacin  and oral fluconazole was initiated  but due to poor response  treatment was switched to topical voriconazole and oral fluconazole.    Results:  The patient showed significant improvement within two weeks  with complete resolution of the infiltrate and formation of a corneal scar by two months. No recurrence was observed at four-month follow-up. The case underscores the role of prior herpetic disease and corticosteroid therapy as predisposing factors for Acremonium keratitis.    Conclusion: Acremonium keratitis is a rare but serious condition  particularly in patients with healed herpetic eye disease or immunosuppression. Early diagnosis through microbiological testing and tailored antifungal therapy  such as voriconazole  is critical for successful outcomes.

To find out the progression of glaucoma   MATERIALS AND METHODS cross-sectional observational study at a  tertiary care center a period of one year  CONCLUSIONS  1. CDR vs. Vessel Density  o Shows a negative correlation (as CDR increases  vessel density decreases).  o This indicates worse glaucoma progression with higher CDR values.  2. CDR vs. Mean Deviation (MD) in HVF  o A strong negative correlation suggests higher CDR values are associated with  greater visual field loss.  3. CDR vs. OCT RNFL Thickness  o A negative correlation implies thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer with  increasing CDR  supporting glaucoma progression.  4. Mean Deviation (MD) vs. OCTA Vessel Density  o A strong positive correlation suggests lower vessel density  corresponds with worsening visual field defects.  The study further confirms that glaucoma severity directly impacts vessel density  with patients  in advanced stages exhibiting significantly lower vessel density compared to those in early and  moderate stages. Regression analysis suggests that vessel density can serve as a predictive  marker for visual field loss  reinforcing the importance of OCTA in clinical practice for early  detection and monitoring. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated an AUC value of 0.954 for  distinguishing early from advanced glaucoma  highlighting high diagnostic accuracy of vessel  density as a biomarker for disease progression., DOS Members, S-3732, Dr. LOKESH KUMAR SINGH, drlokeshgeorgian2000@yahoo.com, 9720070704, LLRM MEDICAL COLLEGE, DOS Members, G-73, Dr. ALKA GUPTA, dralkag@gmail.com, 9412201639, LLRM MEDICAL COLLEGE, DOS Members, D-6474, Dr. JAISHREE DWIVEDI, DRJAISHREEDWIVEDI@GMAIL.COM, 9837502847, LLRM MEDICAL COLLEGE, DOS Members, G-6680, Dr. PRIYANKA GUSAIN, PRIYANKA.OPEN.WITH.SMILE@GMAIL.COM, 9410550155, LLRM MEDICAL COLLEGE, 2025-03-30 20:02:35]

METHODS This case report describes an 11-year-old female with bilateral  progressive  painless vision loss since childhood.BCVA was 6/36 in OD and counting fingers at 3 meters in OS. Undilated SLE showed a well-centered lens in the OD  while only a partial view of the lens margin was visible in the OS  prompting the decision for surgical intervention. Dilated SLE revealed inferior lens subluxation in the OD and inferotemporal subluxation in the OS — an atypical presentation. Fundus examination showed myopic changes with a normal foveolar reflex.The patient underwent lensectomy with iris-claw lens implantation in the OS  resulting in improved postoperative BCVA of 6/24. She was started on pyridoxine supplementation to manage underlying metabolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder due to cystathionine ?-synthase deficiency  causing elevated methionine and homocysteine levels. Ocular manifestations  particularly ectopia Lentis  seen in 70% of cases by 8 years of age and often with high myopia and progressive vision loss.This case highlights the importance of early clinical recognition of homocystinuria  as patients often first present to ophthalmologists due to ectopia Lentis and high myopia. Prompt surgical management  combined with dietary control and vitamin supplementation  is essential to prevent complications such as optic atrophy and glaucoma  significantly improving visual outcomes and quality of life. , DOS Members, C-5487, DR.

METHODS : Patients visiting glaucoma services underwent detailed ophthalmic examination including disc evaluation  gonioscopy  applanation tonometry and Humphreys Visual Field. Those fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled after a written informed consent. 30 patients were divided  10 each in early  moderate and severe glaucoma damage according to Hodapp Parish Anderson Classification along with 30 consenting  age and gender-matched healthy controls. BMO-MRW and RNFL thickness were noted using the Carl Zeiss Cirrus HD-OCT 500 (Carl Zeiss Meditec  Inc.  Dublin  CA). Data was analyzed as given using group statistical tests. Results : BMO MRW was significantly thinner in POAG patients compared to controls across various sectors (ST  SN  IT  IN  N  T). In comparison to RNFL thickness  BMO MRW in all sectors distinguished POAG from controls but did not differentiate between different stages of the POAG. BMO MRW demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy for POAG than RNFL thickness across all stages. The diagnostic accuracy exceeded 95% across all stages  and over 98% in severe POAG. Conclusion: The study results show that BMO MRW is a more accurate diagnostic marker as compared to OCT RNFL thickness for patients with different severity of primary open angle glaucoma. Further studies are needed to support this study.  Declaration: Data is original & there are no plagiarism. Ethics committee approval has been obtained : F.

Both patients presented with blurring of vision in the unaffected eye one month after the trauma. Fundus examination revealed multiple areas of serous retinal detachment  and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed multiple serous retinal fluid (SRF) pockets with associated bacillary layer detachment. Both patients were treated with five doses of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP)  followed by high-dose oral steroids. Vision improved significantly following IVMP administration. Conclusion: Early-onset sympathetic ophthalmitis can develop in the contralateral eye following ocular trauma. Prompt recognition of visual changes and timely intervention with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) followed by oral steroids can significantly improve visual outcomes. This highlights the importance of early detection and aggressive treatment in preventing permanent vision loss in such cases , DOS Members, S-4880, Dr. SHALINI SINGH, drshalini15@gmail.com, 9958927755, Dr Shroff Charity Eye Centre , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 20:06:45]

METHODS: A 25-year-old male from Udhampur presented with complaints of a left-sided headache radiating temporally for 1–2 weeks. His visual acuity was normal (6/6) in both eyes  and intraocular pressure measured 15 mmHg bilaterally. Slit-lamp examination revealed Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) and a lower eyelid chalazion in the left eye. On dilated fundus examination  an incidental optic disc coloboma was identified in the left eye  characterized by a distinct inferior excavation with pale margins. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging showed significant thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) in the left eye  with an average thickness reduced to 49 µm. The thinning was particularly evident in the superior  inferior  and temporal quadrants. In contrast  the right eye demonstrated a normal optic disc appearance with an average RNFL thickness of 103 µm. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates that congenital optic disc coloboma may remain clinically unnoticed into adulthood  becoming evident only upon incidental examination. Marked RNFL thinning underscores the importance of utilizing advanced diagnostic imaging techniques like OCT for early identification. Comprehensive eye evaluations  including dilated fundus and OCT examinations  even in patients without visual complaints  facilitate early diagnosis  patient counseling  regular monitoring  and timely intervention to prevent potential complications.  , Non Members, , Dr. Kanavdeep Kapoor, kanavdeepkapoor@gmail.com, 7780908307, ASCOMS JAMMU, Non Members, , Dr  Vipul Khajuria, vipleo@gmail.com, 9622137161, ASCOMS JAMMU, Non Members, , Dr Rushali Gupta, gupta.rushali77@gmail.com, 9419215040, ASCOMS JAMMU, Non Members, , Dr. Renu Hashia, renuhashia66@gmail.com, 9419153396, ASCOMS JAMMU, 2025-03-30 20:07:45]

Have history of Diabetes Mellitus for 4years. Neuroimaging revealed no compressive or vascular lesions. The patient reported persistent  severe retro-orbital pain unresponsive to standard analgesics. Considering a possible neuropathic component  Gabapentin and Nortriptyline were introduced at bedtime. Remarkably  the patient reported rapid and sustained pain relief within days  while ophthalmoplegia persisted.  Method: Gabapentin  an anticonvulsant with analgesic properties  and Nortriptyline  a tricyclic antidepressant  both modulate neuropathic pain pathways. Their efficacy in this case suggests a central or peripheral sensitization underlying the pain component of third nerve palsy. This atypical presentation highlights the importance of considering alternative pain mechanisms when conventional treatment fails.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the potential of Gabapentin and Nortriptyline as effective therapeutic options for pain management in third cranial nerve palsy  challenging traditional paradigms and expanding our approach to cranial nerve-related pain. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms and identify patients who may benefit from this approach  Who knew Gabapentin could moonlight as a nerve whisperer?

METHODS – A retrospective study was conducted on 14 pediatric patients aged less than 18 years who presented to the casualty and ophthalmology outpatient department (OPD) with a history of ocular trauma. The study was carried out from September 2024 to March 2025. Data were collected on patient demographics  presenting symptoms along with time of presentation  duration and type of injury  and underlying causes. A comprehensive ocular examination  including detailed anterior and posterior segment evaluation  was performed. Management strategies were then analyzed based on the severity and type of trauma. Visual outcome was noted on follow up. CONCLUSION –Males were more prone to ocular trauma than females. Firecracker injuries were the leading cause  followed by wooden stick trauma.  Blunt trauma was significantly more common. The majority of cases received treatment within 3 hours  but some had delayed presentation. The time of presentation varied from 2 hrs to 2 days. Management strategies ranged from conservative treatment to surgical intervention that was required for 2 patients  depending on the severity of the injury.  Preventive measures  such as parental supervision and childproofing environments  play a crucial role in reducing the incidence of pediatric ocular trauma.

Although typically associated with viral infections or autoimmune diseases  FBA secondary to tubercular reactivation is exceptionally uncommon. Neuroretinitis  presenting with optic disc edema and macular star formation  further complicates this rare presentation.  Case Presentation: A young adult presented with sudden  painless bilateral vision loss  photophobia  and floaters. Fundus examination revealed diffuse  translucent perivascular sheathing resembling frosted branches  accompanied by optic disc edema and a macular star pattern  consistent with neuroretinitis. Systemic evaluation revealed no history of recent infections or autoimmune disorders. However  tuberculin skin testing and interferon-gamma release assay were positive  suggesting latent tubercular infection reactivation. Chest imaging showed fibrotic lesions consistent with prior healed tuberculosis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable  and MRI brain with orbit was normal.  The patient was initiated on a four-drug anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) alongside Systemic Corticosteroids.  Remarkable improvement in visual acuity and resolution of retinal findings were noted within weeks.  Discussion: This case highlights the rare occurrence of bilateral frosted branch angiitis with neuroretinitis as a manifestation of reactivated tuberculosis. Prompt recognition and initiation of ATT are crucial to preserving vision and preventing further complications.  Conclusion: In endemic regions  tubercular etiology should be considered in atypical retinal vasculitis presentations  including bilateral frosted branch angiitis with neuroretinitis.

STUDY DESIGN-Prospective comparative  interventional study.  METHODS- 60 eyes(n=60) of 60 patients having deficient posterior capsular support were  included and randomly divided into 2 group  group A(RPICL  n=30)and group B (sutureless glueless SFIOL  n=30). The primary outcome was visual acuity and secondary outcomes were  operating time  endothelial cell count( ECC)  and complications. RESULTS- There was  marked improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) among both the groups. 60%  patients of RPICL group and 50% patients of SFIOL group had final BCVA between 6/6- 6/24 followed by 6/36- 6/60 in 20% and 33% in RPICL and SFIOL group respectively. Only 20% and 17% patients of RPICLs and SFIOLs group respectively had BCVA <6/60No  statistically significant intergroup difference was found in postoperative BCVA  (p=0.607).Surgical time was significantly lesser in RPICL implantation compared to sutureless  SFIOL(p<0.0001). Ovalization in pupil shape and mild iritis were observed in 13.6% and 6.66%  patients of RPICL group respectively while intraoperative slippage of haptics were observed in  10% patients of SFIOL group. There was significant loss of endothelial cells in both the groups  (p<0.05) but no significant intergroup difference was observed (p>0.05). CONCLUSION-Both  the technique were equally efficacious in correcting aphakia but SFIOL is technically  demanding surgery whereas RPICL can have pupil and iris related issues.Keywords - Sutureless , Non Members, , , , 9451875355, GSVM MEDICAL COLLEGE KANPUR, Non Members, , , , 9506740966, GSVM MEDICAL COLLEGE KANPUR, Non Members, , , , , GSVM MEDICAL COLLEGE KANPUR, Non Members, , , , , GSVM MEDICAL COLLEGE KANPUR, 2025-03-30 20:47:05]

Methods: This study included 11 eyes of 11 patients with NVG and VH. The eyes underwent transscleral cyclo photocoagulation  pars plana vitrectomy  near-confluent pan-retinal photocoagulation  and intravitreal bevacizumab in the same sitting. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  IOP  and number of glaucoma medications were recorded at baseline  and 1 3 and 6 months. Results: Eleven eyes of 11 patients (10 Male  1 Female  Mean age 57.25?±?5.9 years) were included. NVG underlying conditions included retinal vein occlusion (4 eyes) proliferative diabetic retinopathy (5 eyes) and vasculitis (2 eyes). Mean IOP decreased postoperatively from 49.66 ± 8.52 mmHg to 17.54 ± 10.28 mmHg  19.63 ± 11.91mmHg and 16.9 ± 7.93 mmHg at 1 month  3 month  and 6 month respectively. The glaucoma medication also decreased from 6  to 2.81 ± 2.35. Two eyes had hyphema at postoperative day 1  both of which resolved on its own within a week. No eyes required repeat pars plana vitrectomy or laser augmentation. Two eyes underwent trabeculectomy due to uncontrolled IOP within 3 months of primary surgical intervention. Two eyes received repeat antiVEGF injections to tackle macular edema. Conclusions: A single integrative surgery to control ischemia and IOP is useful and safe and is a potential consideration to be included in the treatment algorithm as an early intervention before proceeding to filtering surgery in NVG. , DOS Members, V-7729, Dr. SAURABH VERMA, DR.SAURABH.VERMA.SV@GMAIL.COM, 9910402435, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre For Ophthalmic Sciences  All India Institute Of Medical Sciences  New Delhi, DOS Members, D-517, Dr. TANUJ DADA, tanujdada@hotmail.com, 9873336315, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre For Ophthalmic Sciences  All India Institute Of Medical Sciences  New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 20:48:53]

On fundus examination  a 3 clock hour Giant retinal tear (GRT) with a rolled flap but no subretinal fluid (SRF)  extending from 1 o clock to 4 o clock . Patient was advised vitrectomy with endolaser and SiO/Gas  however due to uncontrolled blood pressure (200/120mm Hg)  we proceeded with urgent laser photocoagulation. He was advised strict left lateral positioning  and to avoid head elevation. He was also counselled about need for vitrectomy in case photocoagulation fails. To our pleasant surprise  the GRT did not progress and this ultra widefield photograph  taken 7 years after the initial laser treatment  highlights the importance of quick thinking with minimal intervention. Although GRTs almost always require surgical intervention  this case reminds us not to always jump to a surgical intervention  especially when patient is unfit for urgent surgery.

They study population were randomized into 2 groups A and B (20 each) by envelope method. The study group underwent Phacoemulsification with bent angle needle goniectomy (BANG) and the control group underwent Phacoemulsification alone. The patients were examined preoperatively  and they were followed up postoperatively on a schedule of 1 week  1month  3months and 6months . The reduction in IOP and the number of AGMs was noted. Patients lost to follow up were excluded. Results : The study revealed that the IOP decreased from 25.45±1.68 mmHg to 18.97±1.65 mmHg in study Group and from 23.03±2.48 mmHg to 21.31±1.33 mmHg in control Group at last follow?up of 6 months. IOP was significantly less at all time points during the follow?up period (1 week  1 month  3 months 6 months) in the study group compared to the control group. The use of topical AGMs reduced from 2.41±0.62 pre-operatively to 0.34±0.55 at 3 months 0.76±0.63 and 6 months post phaco-BANG and from 0.83±0.88 pre-operatively to 0.72±0.52 at 3 months  1.1±0.77 at 6 months in phaco at follow up which represented reduction of 70% and 13% increment in AGMs respectively Conclusion: Phacoemulsification combined with bent angle needle goniectomy demonstrates a significantly greater reduction in IOP and a marked decrease in the need for anti-glaucoma medications compared to standalone phacoemulsification in patients with primary open angle glaucoma and visually significant cataract, DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 21:02:48]

Methods: This prospective  comparative study included 100 eyes from 50 patients undergoing cataract surgery via either the 2.2 mm or 2.8 mm incision techniques. Intraoperative parameters measured included ultrasound phacoemulsification power  effective phacoemulsification time (EPT)  total surgical duration  and balanced salt solution (BSS) volume. Postoperative outcomes evaluated were uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (UCVA  CDVA)  surgically induced astigmatism (SIA)  endothelial cell loss  and complications. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value of less than 0.05. Results: The microcoaxial group showed significantly better surgical efficiency compared to the traditional group  with lower phacoemulsification power (14.3% vs. 19.2%  P = 0.001)  reduced EPT (4.5 s vs. 9.2 s  P = 0.002)  shorter total surgical time (690 s vs. 740 s  P = 0.04)  and less BSS usage (118 mL vs. 148 mL  P = 0.003). Both techniques provided similar postoperative visual acuity  astigmatism  and endothelial cell preservation. Minor complications occurred infrequently and showed no statistically significant difference between groups. Conclusion: The 2.2 mm coaxial microincision phacoemulsification technique offered superior surgical efficiency without compromising visual outcomes or patient safety relative to traditional 2.8 mm phacoemulsification.

Problems that we usually face in these patients are 1.lens capsule integrity which holds the natural lens in place may be compromised or weakened  this may increase the chances of capsular tear or rupture during surgery. 2.emulsifying the lens fragments is typically difficult in these patients as the cortex is liquified and the nucleus is small making it difficult to hold and fragment during which the nucleus may tumble in the anterior chamber. 3.there is risk of posterior capsular rent due as the nucleus never gets holded with the probe which might lead to pc tear. This video demonstrates a different approach by placing the IOL in the bag before emulsifying the nucleus once the liquified cortex has been aspirated., Non Members, , NIKHIL MAHAVIR GANDHI, DR.NIKHIL@HOTMAIL.COM, 9503408000, ANUPAM EYE HOSPITAL AND LASER CENTRE, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 21:06:52]

Methods: A 45-year-old male presented with intermittent floaters in the right eye (RE) and a history of ocular trauma in the left eye (LE) two years prior. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/6 in RE and 6/24 in LE. Anterior segment examination was normal in RE  while LE had lenticular  changes. Fundus examination of RE revealed a live  motile nematode migrating in the vitreous  while the LE fundus was obscured due to cataract. B-scan ultrasonography of LE ruled out intraocular nematodes or inflammation. Results: On follow-up  the nematode in RE had coiled along the superior retina without signs of vitritis or retinal damage. The patient underwent uneventful cataract surgery in LE  with no intraocular nematode detected postoperatively. Given the persistent presence of the worm in RE  pars plana vitrectomy was performed for removal  leading to a successful outcome. Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of routine fundus examination  even in asymptomatic patients.

To highlight the diagnostic challenge posed by multifocal bullous central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) and its potential confusion with other serious ocular conditions  such as VKH disease  uveal effusion  and metastatic carcinoma. Methods:? A 29-year-old male patient with a one-week history of progressive bilateral diminution of vision was referred with an initial diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. His visual acuity was 2/60 in the right eye (OD) and 6/60 in the left eye (OS). The patient had no significant medical or systemic history. Fundus examination revealed no cells in vitreous with bilateral multifocal serous detachments with inferior exudative retinal detachments and multiple lattice degenerations. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) were performed  which were suggestive of multifocal CSCR. The patient was then managed with focal laser photocoagulation  acetazolamide  eplerenone and lifestyle modifications. Results:? At one-month follow-up  the exudative retinal detachment had completely resolved. The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 6/9 in both eyes. Conclusion:? Misdiagnosis of multifocal CSCR as VKH disease or other conditions may lead to unnecessary tests and treatments. Early and accurate diagnosis  aided by OCT and FFA  is crucial for effective management. This case highlights not only the importance of differential diagnosis but also the positive impact on the patients quality of life  as he was able to proceed with his planned wedding two months after treatment  illustrating the significance of timely intervention., DOS Members, R-6659, DR.

Key considerations include early detection  optimized medical management with close follow-up  and appropriately timed minimally invasive surgery MATERIAL AND METHODS We present a series of retrospective study of 18  patients with SCH occurring in association with cataract and vitreous surgery . All had large hemorrhagic choroidals with nine eyes presenting kissing choroidal detachment  three eyes with associated retinal detachment  and one eye with intravitreous hemorrhage. Surgery was delayed one to three weeks to allow B Scan guided liquefaction of the blood clot. The procedure consisted of anterior chamber fluid infusion  drainage sclerotomies  with pars plana vitrectomy with additional silicon oil tamponade  in 4 cases. Follow-up of patients ranged from 6 months to 14 years RESULTS The results showed that risk factors including advanced age  taking anticoagulants   hypertension   glaucoma  vitrectomy  silicone oil removal  high myopia  aphakia    sudden intraocular pressure drop during surgery.  Visual acuity after surgery improved in all eyes ranging from  from light perception to 6/9.  CONCLUSION Appositional suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a serious ocular complication with a guarded visual prognosis. Eyes with retinal incarceration  compared to eyes without retinal incarceration  had an increased rate of postoperative hypotony and poor visual outcome. , DOS Members, C-4095, DR.

Secondary outcomes studied were binocular defocus curves  the modulation transfer function (MTF) and visual acuity for near and distance.  METHOD: A prospective single-center observational case series of 24 months duration focused on 40 patients with age-related cataracts (20 patients in each group) who underwent uneventful phacoemulsification in both eyes.  RESULTS: The study revealed that the Tecnis Eyhance ICB00 group had significantly better intermediate vision (UIVA) with p<0.0001 and near vision (UNVA) with p<0.0001 at one month postoperatively. The differences in corrected intermediate vision acuity (CIVA) and corrected near vision acuity (CNVA) were not statistically significant between the two groups. Additionally  there was no significant difference in distance visual acuities  both uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) with p=0.915 and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) with p=0.317  between the two groups. Furthermore  there was no significant difference in modulation transfer function (MTF) curves between both groups with p>0.05  suggesting that the Tecnis Eyhance ICB00 intraocular lens provides comparable distance vision and better intermediate and near vision compared to Tecnis ZCB00 intraocular lens without deterioration of contrast sensitivity.  CONCLUSION: The comparative analysis reveals distinct advantages of Tecnis Eyhance ICB00 lens  over Tecnis ZCB00 intraocular lens  as it offers a broader range of vision encompassing far and intermediate distances without compromising contrast and also reducing dependency on glasses for tasks requiring intermediate focus., DOS Members, M-6110, Dr. SHUBHA MEHTA, mehta.shubha@gmail.com, 9968206438, Shroff Eye Centre, DOS Members, SD-527, Dr. GURPREET SINGH, doctorgsa@hotmail.com, 9818016416, Shroff Eye Centre, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 21:31:12]

Settings: This is a prospective interventional case series of 16 eyes (14 patients) with diabetic macular edema and BCVA <6/9. These 16 eyes were further divided into 2 groups  group A with 10 eyes that had received intravitreal Anti-VEGF as the primary treatment but had shown subnormal response after 3 monthly injections  hence were given intravitreal Ozurdex implant  and group B with 6 eyes that were treatment-naive eyes and were given Ozurdex as primary treatment.  Methods:  All patients were evaluated at baseline with BCVA  Intraocular pressure (IOP)  Central macular thickness (CMT) on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and then were given a single intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex) . All eyes were then followed up monthly for 4 months with BCVA  IOP and OCT macula.   Conclusion : Ozurdex implant is a safe and efficacious treatment modality for DME. However  the eyes treated early showed better visual improvement than eyes treated after poor response to Anti-VEGF.

The protective coating of the irrigation cannula suddenly sheared off  dispersing metallic particles throughout the anterior chamber. Despite meticulous washout  some remnants remained deeply embedded within the corneal stroma  particularly at the temporal clear corneal incision site.

Patil Medical College Hospital and Research Center Pune, , Interesting Cases, Ocular Oncology, Granular Cell Tumor of the Orbit: A Rare Masquerader of Lacrimal Gland Pathology, , Purpose: Granular cell tumor (GCT) is an uncommon  benign neoplasm arising from Schwann cells  with orbital involvement being exceedingly rare. This case report highlights the clinical and radiological presentation of orbital GCT  which closely resembled a lacrimal gland tumor  emphasizing the diagnostic and therapeutic approach.  Methods: A 53-year-old female presented with progressive swelling of the left upper eyelid and gradual  painless vision loss over one year. Clinical evaluation revealed a firm  non-tender orbital mass without inflammatory features. Imaging demonstrated a well-defined  retroorbital lesion with T2 hypointensity extending to the orbital apex  closely associated with the optic nerve. The patient underwent a lateral orbitotomy with complete tumor excision.  Results: Histopathological analysis identified polygonal tumor cells with abundant granular cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed Schwann cell origin  with strong S100 and CD68 positivity. Postoperatively  the patient recovered well  with no recurrence observed during follow-up.  Conclusion: Although rare  orbital GCT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retroorbital and lacrimal gland tumors. Accurate diagnosis relies on imaging and histopathological confirmation  while surgical excision remains the preferred treatment. This case highlights the importance of recognizing atypical orbital tumors to ensure timely and appropriate management., Non Members, , Pradipta Potdar, Pradiptapotdar95@gmail.com, 9869724738, Dr. D.Y.

Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted on 50 participants of age ?50 years comprising 25 PEX patients without glaucoma and 25 age-matched healthy controls.Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation including slit-lamp biomicroscopy  intraocular pressure measurement  and OCT-based RNFL thickness analysis in all quadrants  were performed. Statistical analysis was conducted to assess differences between the two groups. Results:Mean RNFL thickness was significantly lower in PEX patients compared to controls (p < 0.05)  with the superior and inferior quadrants most affected.Though participants had no clinical signs of glaucoma  these findings suggest early neurodegenerative changes in PEX. Conclusion:The study reveals early RNFL alterations in PEX even in absence of glaucoma emphasizing the need for routine OCT monitoring for detecting structural changes before functional loss. Early detection can aid in early intervention for glaucoma progression., DOS Members, M-1779, Dr. JAISHRI MURLI MANOHER, drjmmanoherpbm@gmail.com, 9413468777, , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 21:46:21]

METHODS- A 50-year-old hypertensive male did not gain good vision following implantation of 3-piece +20.0 diopter intraocular lens (IOL) in his left eye (LE). Five months later  he was referred to retina services with gross diminution of vision and whiteness of the cornea. We did an ultrasound B scan to assess the posterior segment. The pars plana vitrectomy could not be done due to corneal opacity. The specimen obtained from the anterior segment wash was sent for culture and sensitivity.   RESULTS- The LE had perception of light with an inaccurate projection of rays in all quadrants. On slit lamp examination  the cornea showed edema  Descemet’s membrane folds  peripheral vascularization and a blood-stained endothelium. The intraocular pressure (IOP)  keratometry and axial length were 12 mmHg  41.5 x 45.75 and 22.25 mm respectively. The ultrasound B scan showed a well-defined vitreous opacity with moderate to high echoes in the posterior segment pointing towards vitritis. The anterior segment specimen grew colonies of A. baumannii sensitive to cotrimoxazole  minocycline and levofloxacin. We prescribed oral levofloxacin 750 mg once a day for ten days  but his ocular condition did not improve. The IOP reduced to 8 mmHg  and a repeat ultrasound showed serous CD in two quadrants. Even with systemic steroids  inflammation did not resolve fully. CONCLUSIONS- A. baumannii should be kept as a differential diagnosis in cases of CPE. As it is multi-drug resistant  endophthalmitis caused by this bacterium has poor prognosis.   , Non Members, , Aditi Yadav, aditi108108@gmail.com, 7428057928, Guru Nanak Eye Centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, Non Members, , Alok Kumar , alokrohilla99@gmail.com, 8059484067, Guru Nanak Eye centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, Non Members, , Anjali K, anjalikpayyanur7@gmail.com, 9447864303, Guru Nanak Eye Centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 21:48:48]

On fundus examination  a 3 clock hour Giant retinal tear (GRT) with a rolled flap but no subretinal fluid (SRF)  extending from 1 o clock to 4 o clock . Patient was advised vitrectomy with endolaser and SiO/Gas  however due to uncontrolled blood pressure (200/120mm Hg)  we proceeded with urgent laser photocoagulation. He was advised strict left lateral positioning  and to avoid head elevation. He was also counselled about need for vitrectomy in case photocoagulation fails. To our pleasant surprise  the GRT did not progress and this ultra widefield photograph  taken 7 years after the initial laser treatment  highlights the importance of quick thinking with minimal intervention. Although GRTs almost always require surgical intervention  this case reminds us not to always jump to a surgical intervention  especially when patient is unfit for urgent surgery.

Methods- A 60 years old female did not gain good vision following an uneventful phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the right eye (RE). One year after cataract surgery  she consulted a Retina Specialist. There was no history of trauma  radiation exposure  reduced scotopic vision or any other intraocular surgery. Routine blood investigations  electrocardiogram and detailed ocular examination was done.  Results- She had a BCVA of LogMAR 1.0 (20/200  6/60) in RE. The RE had an axial length (AL) of 23.50 mm and IOL power of 21.0 dioptres. The ultrawide field fundus examination saw parafoveal chorio-retinal atrophy without significant peripheral myopic degeneration. On optical coherence tomography (OCT)  a central foveal thickness of 138 microns with foveal scarring was noticed. There was a full-thickness PFH between the fovea and optic disc having a height of 198 microns  base diameter of 240 microns  arm lengths of 203 microns and 206 microns  and a minimum linear dimension of 42 microns. The optical coherence tomography angiography scan showed a reduced vessel density in the superficial and deep retina  and increased visibility of choroidal vessels in outer retina chorio-capillaries  chorio-capillaries and choroid slab at the PFH. The ultrasound B scan was anechoic and there was no posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).  Conclusions- The AL  IOL power and fundus examination did not indicate pathological myopia. As there was no preceding PVD or retinal surgery  the underlying retino-choroidal atrophy most probably caused the full-thickness PFH.  , Non Members, , Aditi Yadav, aditi108108@gmail.com, 7428057928, Guru Nanak Eye Centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, Non Members, , Alok Kumar , alokrohilla99@gmail.com, 8059484067, Guru Nanak Eye centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, Non Members, , Anjali K, anjalikpayyanur7@gmail.com, 9447864303, Guru Nanak Eye Centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, DOS Members, M-8769, Dr. HITENKUMAR MIYANI, miyanihiten10@gmail.com, 7575019211, Guru Nanak Eye Centre affiliated with Maulana Azad Medical College  New Delhi, 2025-03-30 21:59:45]

Herein  we describe an unusual case of pituitary metastasis presenting as Foster-Kennedy syndrome. Methods: A 54-year lady  presented with bilateral subacute  painless severe visual loss. She had past history of being treated for metastatic thyroid cancer. At presentation  she had bilateral  asymmetric  optic disc edema with partial optic atrophy [variant of Foster Kennedy syndrome(FKS)] and right eye sixth cranial nerve paresis. A recent oncology check PET-CT scan was deemed all clear. However  based on the confrontation visual fields  we insisted for a repeat neuro-imaging. Results: The MRI imaging confirmed large compressive lesions in sellar and occipital areas. Histopathology confirmed thyroid cancer metastasis to the pituitary gland region  which was managed by radiotherapy. Partial  but useful vision could be restored in right eye  while complete optic atrophy ensued in left eye. Conclusion: Chiasmal compression  due to metastasis  can be an uncommon cause of visual loss  in a known case of cancer. Such lesions can have combination of papilledema and partial optic atrophy (FKS).

Though most of them doesn’t require treatment  large DMD if not treated properly can result in pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and severe visual impairment. To aid the clinical diagnosis of DMD  newer technologies like ASOCT  UBM are very much useful. We present a case series of DMD encountered in our hospital  treated by Pneumodescemetopexy and their visual outcomes. Methods This is a hospital based Prospective interventional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Karnataka – Minto Ophthalmic Hospital  Regional Institute of Ophthalmology Bengaluru from June 2023 to November 2024 among patients who developed DMD following cataract surgery and have undergone Pneumodescemetopexy with air injection. Informed consent from patients and hospital ethical committee clearance were obtained. Slit-lamp photography and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) were done before and after the procedure. Patients were followed up and documented BCVA and anterior segment findings. Results Proper reattachment of Descemet’s membrane was observed in all cases following the procedure and out of 14 patients studied 9 showed significant visual improvement from hand movements positive (HM +) or counting fingers (CF) to 6/24 and above. Conclusions  We have observed that Pneumodescemetopexy with air injection is effective and adequate as a first line treatment for Descemet’s membrane detachment following cataract surgery  even in cases presenting as late as 4 weeks postoperatively.  , Non Members, , DR.

Case Presentation: A 30- year old male was referred for fundus evaluation. He was a known case of B-ALL and presented with diminution of vision of left eye while on maintenance therapy for B-ALL. Visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/36 in left eye. Anterior segment was normal  and fundus findings of right eye was normal  where as left eye showed macular involvement along with dot-blot hemorrhages suggestive of leukemic retinopathy. Patient was advised systemic chemotherapy in view of CNS relapse. On follow up  the macular lesion has reduced and hemorrhages resolved post chemotherapy.  Results: Visual acuity  fundoscopic examination  macular OCT and fluorescein angiography were done. These tests showed minimal intraretinal fluid with no CNVM. Patient was followed up regularly and till the completion of his chemotherapy. Though his vision did not improve  there was no further deterioration of his visual acuity.  Conclusion: Macular involvement although rare  may occur in a case of B-ALL and is considered as relapse or CNS involvement  indicating urgent treatment.

This study explores the dynamic relationship between AC depth and IOP shifts following cataract surgery  analyzing how these parameters interact and influence postoperative outcomes. An increase in AC depth is commonly observed postoperatively due to lens removal  leading to changes in aqueous humor dynamics and  consequently  fluctuations in IOP. While many patients experience a transient decrease in IOP  others may develop postoperative spikes  necessitating careful monitoring and management. Understanding these shifts is crucial for optimizing surgical techniques and postoperative care to enhance visual recovery and minimize complications. This review synthesizes current evidence on AC depth changes and IOP variations after cataract extraction  offering insights into their clinical implications and management strategies.        , DOS Members, S-3382, DR.

Patients typically present with lidswelling  lid retraction  proptosis  and diplopia. Aim- To Observe Clinical Manifestations in Thyroid Ophthalmopathy in Autoimmune Thyroid Disease. Method- We present a observational cross-sectional study  with few patients without prior diagnosis of hyperthyroidism  all of which referred subjective asymmetry in their eyes or constant watering with protrusion of eyes. Diagnosis of TED was clinical and based on thyroid disorder associated with one of the following signs: eyelid retraction and/or lag  proptosis  restrictive myopathy  dysthyroid optic neuropathy  fluctuating eyelid edema  conjunctival chemosis and/or diffuse redness  caruncular edema. Orbital imaging was requested to look for other orbital pathologies and optic neuropathy. Activity and severity were assessed using the CAS score. Results- Patients positive for anti-TPO antibody were recorded.The patients which developed Compressive neuropathy received pulse intravenous glucocorticoids therapy while others were started on oral steroids. All the patients achieved quiescence of the clinical activity after 1 complete course of oral steroids on 3 months follow-up except few with the history of chronic smoking and are still under our observation due to CAS score being 4/7 while others being < 3. Conclusion- Our data on-• Age• Interval between the onset of Dysthyroid disease and thyroid eye disease• Duration of hyperthyroidism and thyroid eye disease.• smoking habits• DM indicates visual morbidities can set in several months after the onset of dysthyroid condition.

On fundus examination  a 3 clock hour Giant retinal tear (GRT) with a rolled flap but no subretinal fluid (SRF)  extending from 1 o clock to 4 o clock . Patient was advised vitrectomy with endolaser and SiO/Gas  however due to uncontrolled blood pressure (200/120mm Hg)  we proceeded with urgent laser photocoagulation. He was advised strict left lateral positioning  and to avoid head elevation. He was also counselled about need for vitrectomy in case photocoagulation fails. To our pleasant surprise  the GRT did not progress and this ultra widefield photograph  taken 7 years after the initial laser treatment  highlights the importance of quick thinking with minimal intervention. Although GRTs almost always require surgical intervention  this case reminds us not to always jump to a surgical intervention  especially when patient is unfit for urgent surgery.

Methods: This hospital-based  cross-sectional analytical study was conducted on 50 senile cataract patients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals at a tertiary care center in Northwestern Rajasthan. Blood samples were collected under aseptic precautions and serum electrolyte levels were measured using standard biochemical methods. Cataracts were graded into immature  mature  and hypermature stages based on clinical evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the significance of electrolyte differences between groups. Results: The mean serum sodium level in cataract patients (145.52 ± 4.40 mEq/L) was significantly higher than in controls (140.80 ± 2.64 mEq/L  p < 0.01). Serum potassium levels were slightly elevated in cataract patients (4.28 ± 0.20 mEq/L) compared to controls (4.19 ± 0.23 mEq/L  p = 0.03). Among cataract subtypes  immature cataracts had the highest mean sodium levels (147.38 mEq/L)  decreasing with cataract maturity (p = 0.02). Potassium levels varied significantly across stages (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Elevated serum sodium and altered potassium levels were associated with senile cataract  suggesting that electrolyte imbalance may contribute to lens opacification.

Methods: A total of 21 patients aged 12-32 years  diagnosed with Non-Accommodative Esotropia not corrected with lenses  were included after applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comprehensive clinical assessments  including visual acuity  cycloplegic retinoscopy  stereopsis  Krimsky test  and PBCT  were performed on all patients. Surgical intervention consisted primarily of horizontal muscle recession/resection. Follow-up was conducted for over six months to monitor postoperative outcomes.  Results: Of 17 855 ophthalmology visits during the study period  164 (0.95%) were diagnosed with strabismus  and 41 (25%) with esotropia. Among these  Non-Accommodative Esotropia was the most common  affecting 22 (53.6%) patients. Surgery  predominantly involving horizontal muscle procedures  yielded favorable results in 13 patients who completed more than six months of follow-up without complications. Postoperative follow-up data indicated significant improvement in alignment at 1  3  and 6 months.  Conclusion: Early diagnosis and surgical intervention for Non-Accommodative Esotropia significantly improve ocular alignment and binocular vision. This study emphasizes the importance of timely surgical intervention and regular follow-up to ensure optimal outcomes. The findings contribute to enhancing preoperative counseling for patients and underscore the necessity for monitoring postoperative results  including potential under- or overcorrection. , Non Members, , sanjiv kumar, , , subharti medical college, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 23:02:38]

Stage one of the surgery included ICCE of the subluxated lens with iridodialysis repair with 10’0 prolene by suturing it to the sclero-corneal tunnel and closure of the scleral defect with a patch graft after excising the prolapsed uveal tissue. A sequential second stage surgery included rehabilitating the patient with a secondary IOL by Yamane’s technique and a single pass four throw pupilloplasty with a 9’0 prolene for the correction of traumatic mydriasis. Results:  The patient achieved an uncorrected vision of 20/40 after the second surgery post-secondary IOL implantation. There were no major complications noted during the surgery or post-operatively.  Conclusion: The above surgery demonstrates the need for timely intervention in complex post traumatic cases with careful planning in order to achieve successful outcomes and to prevent further complication and blindness.   , DOS Members, JD-1732, Dr. ANNU JOON, ANNUJOON@GMAIL.COM, 7011255026, Guru nanak eye center, DOS Members, A-8599, Dr. AYUSH ARYA, ayush28101997@gmail.com, 8059198517, Guru nanak eye center, DOS Members, S-335, DR.

This report highlights its salient features and challenges in management. Methods: A 40 year old woman presented with progressive abaxial proptosis of left eye over two months with ocular motility restriction. Imaging revealed a mass lesion at the lateral aspect of left orbit with destruction of orbital wall. A left anterior orbitotomy with excision of mass was performed and the specimen sent for histopathological evaluation. Results: Histopathologically  the specimen revealed high vascularity with evidence of bone destruction and formation. Immunostains were positive for Smooth Muscle Actin  Desmin  CD-34. In absence of any systemic manifestations  a diagnosis of Primary Osteosarcoma was made. Conclusion: Primary osteosarcoma of the orbit is a rare tumour and diagnosis is based on histological features. Clear margins are challenging to obtain since frozen section of the bone cannot be done. Clinical Implication	Primary osteosarcoma of the orbit requires high degree of suspicion and detailed imaging for evaluation. Definitive diagnosis is based on histopathological study.

Majority individual practioners draw Avastin multiple times directly from the Avastin vial. This may produce rubber Corings which may get injected in the eye. This study aims to assess if Corings are produced when  rubber stoppers of Avastin vials are punctured and if the use of Avastin Puncture Assist Device (APAD)  developed by author  reduces the risks of coring.  Setting: The experimental evaluation was done in collaboration with and at   Indian Institute of Technology  Delhi.   Methods Recently used  Avastin Bottle Rubber stoppers were punctured 16 times each with 23/ 26 /30 gauge needles without APAD and with APAD. These were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for the size of particles generated. An Energy Dispersive X-ray Microanalysis  (EDX) was also carried out to understand the composition of the slivers and compared with controls. The APAD  made of titanium  assists in puncturing the Avastin vial methodically and  without repeat entry through same track. This will allow safe removal of drug through pre-numbered laser cut holes.  Results  Particulate matter of different size (1-10 ?m) and different density (1-10 particles / ?m3) was found on examination of the well plate.   Conclusion Multiple puncturing of the Avastin rubber stopper may lead to production of  rubber Corings/Slivers. These can be aspirated and potentially injected into the eye. The larger the needle gauge the greater the corings., DOS Members, A-8721, Dr. Arjun Aurora, auroraarjun@gmail.com, 9873402267, Dr Shroff Charity Eye Hospital, Non Members, , Prof Neetu Singh, sneetu@iitd.ac.in, 8588826092, Dept of Biotechnology  IIT Delhi, Non Members, , Ms Bartika, dhyaanchand@gmail.com, 8287039310, IIT   Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 23:10:48]

It leads to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and subsequent visual impairment. Understanding the extent of ganglion cell damage and potential for functional recovery is crucial for prognostication and management.  Objective: To assess the impact of optic neuritis on ganglion cell integrity and evaluate the potential for functional recovery using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual function metrics.  Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of patients diagnosed with ON was conducted. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness were measured using spectral-domain OCT. Visual acuity  contrast sensitivity  and visual field indices were assessed. Correlations between structural and functional outcomes were analyzed.  Results: Patients with ON exhibited significant thinning of the GCIPL  correlating strongly with visual function deficits. While partial recovery of visual acuity occurred over time  persistent ganglion cell loss was observed  impacting contrast sensitivity and visual fields. GCIPL thickness was found to be a better predictor of long-term visual dysfunction than RNFL thickness.  Conclusion: Optic neuritis leads to irreversible ganglion cell damage despite clinical recovery of visual acuity. OCT-based monitoring of GCIPL thinning provides valuable prognostic insights. Future neuroprotective and remyelination strategies are needed to mitigate long-term visual impairment., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 23:16:51]

METHOD:63-year-old male presented with complete ptosis with lateral displacement of upper punctum following penetrating trauma to right eye with wire 2 years back. On presentation complete ptosis with no LPS action and chin elevation seen. Patient planned for surgery under 2 stages. Stage 1:medial transposition of upper punctum carried out by suturing of the medial end of tarsus with Medial palpebral ligament with non-absorbable sutures. CEMRI report shows complete transection of LPS muscle with proximal transected margin displacement posterior to superior orbital margin. Stage 2:under General anaesthesia microscopically surgery carried out by taking all established surgical principles in account. In Upper lid   LPS muscle explored and isolated from scar tissue with blunt dissection and sutured to the upper border of tarsus which was not damaged by trauma. All possible care was taken not to overcorrect the position of the lid as the Bell`s phenomenon was poor.  RESULT: Following stage 1 surgery upper punctum positioned at its original level at the desired cosmetically acceptable level. Following 2ND stage surgery Lid elevated to an acceptable height with LPS action of 9mm. Photographic documentation both clinical & radiological  preoperative & postoperative will be provided.  CONCLUSION: Post traumatic ptosis with associated lid abnormalities need thorough clinical evaluation and need for radiological investigation as and when required. In this case the role of CEMRI provided definite diagnosis which prompted us to go for definite treatment with achievement of desired cosmetic and surgical outcome. , DOS Members, K-639, Dr. GOPAL KRUSHNA DAS, dasgk2002@yahoo.co.in, 7838908128, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES & GTB HOSPITAL, DOS Members, SD-1341, Dr. PRAMOD KUMAR SAHU, pujapramod@live.com, 9868399779, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES & GTB HOSPITAL, DOS Members, BD-1876, Dr. NITIKA BERI, BERINITIKA@GMAIL.COM, 9871130760, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES & GTB HOSPITAL, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 23:51:41]

Comparative analysis revealed ROP cases (n=34) had significantly lower gestational age (29.76±1.86 vs 31.76±2.82 weeks  p<0.0001) and birth weight (1.27±0.23 vs 1.51±0.49 kg  p=0.001) compared to controls (n=66). Inflammatory markers showed pronounced differences: CRP levels were markedly elevated in ROP infants (7.61±5.32 vs 3.80±3.97 mg/dL  p=0.001)  while neutrophil percentages were significantly reduced (48.09±12.92% vs 54.51±12.62%  p=0.019). Lymphocyte percentages demonstrated a borderline elevation (39.57±13.52% vs 34.30±12.20%  p=0.051). Metabolic parameters revealed highly significant increases in BUN (24.35±9.62 vs 16.29±6.74 mg/dL  p<0.0001) and significant elevation in total bilirubin (9.17±3.15 vs 7.45±3.65 mg/dL  p=0.022) among ROP cases. Borderline significance was observed for basophils (0.20±0.22% vs 0.12±0.20%  p=0.051). No significant differences were found in oxygen therapy duration  erythrocyte counts  hemoglobin levels (16.98±2.30 vs 16.37±2.91 g/dL)  MCV  MCHC  RDW  leukocyte counts  platelet counts (2.08±1.06 vs 1.91±0.87 lakh/mm³)  NLR (1.61±1.36 vs 1.88±0.96)  PLR  or glucose levels (102.99±45.11 vs 86.95±30.18 mg/dL  p=0.068). These findings establish significant associations between ROP and systemic inflammation (elevated CRP)  renal function (increased BUN)  and bilirubin metabolism  independent of traditional hematological parameters. The results suggest CRP  BUN  and bilirubin may serve as complementary biomarkers for ROP risk stratification in preterm infants  warranting further validation in larger cohorts. We demonstrate that simple blood tests available in any NICU could enhance early identification of high-risk infants. This biomarker panel offers a practical  cost-effective tool for personalized ROP monitoring  particularly valuable in resource-limited settings., Non Members, , Dr. Aparajita Chaudhary, dr.aparajita.ald@gmail.com, 7905788221, REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF OPHTHALMOLOGY MD eye Hospital  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , Dr. Vibha Singh, , , REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF OPHTHALMOLOGY MD eye Hospital  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , Dr. Jitendra Singh, , 8131019511, REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF OPHTHALMOLOGY MD eye Hospital  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-30 23:58:52]

Methods: A 17 year old girl presented with acute onset blurring of vision in both eyes  with no other systemic involvement.  She underwent routine ophthalmologic examination.   Results: Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was Finger counting close to face in both eyes. Anterior segment examination of both the eyes was within normal limits. Fundoscopy showed exudative retinal detachment at posterior pole in both the eyes  with hypopigmented patches involving macula more delineated in the left eye  pointing more towards active choroiditis. Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) of both the eyes showed multiple pigment epithelial detachments. Ultra wide field fundus (UWF) photograph was done which helped to clinch the diagnosis of VKH. Patient was started on short course of high dose steroids (Intravenous IV methylprednisolone) followed by oral steroids with successful resolution of sub retinal fluid and resolved hypopigmented patches with full visual recovery.  Conclusion: Investigations like OCT and UWF help in clinching the diagnoses in cases with similar differentials like ours.

We identified significant biomarker gradients correlating with disease severity and location. Inflammatory markers showed progressive elevation  with CRP increasing from 3.8±4.0 mg/dL in controls to 5.2±3.1 in stage 1 and peaking at 11.4±6.2 in stage 3 (p<0.001)  while zone I cases demonstrated significantly higher levels (9.8±5.7) than zone III (5.1±3.9  p=0.003). Metabolic parameters revealed similar progression  with BUN rising from 21.3±7.2 mg/dL in stage 1 to 29.1±10.8 in stage 3 (p<0.001)  and zone I cases showing 28.4±9.5 versus 22.1±8.3 in zone III (p=0.02). Bilirubin metabolism followed comparable patterns  increasing from 8.4±2.9 mg/dL in stage 1 to 10.8±3.5 in stage 3 (p=0.01)  with zone I cases averaging 1.7mg/dL higher than zone III (p=0.04). The lymphocyte-neutrophil ratio exhibited distinct zone-specific variations (p=0.03) independent of disease stage. While traditional risk factors remained strongly associated (mean GA 29.8±1.9 vs 31.8±2.8 weeks in controls  p<0.0001)  these novel biomarker patterns provided additional stratification power  particularly for posterior zone I disease. Our findings demonstrate  for the first time  quantifiable peripheral blood signatures that track with both ROP severity and anatomical progression  offering potential clinical utility for risk-adapted screening protocols and personalized intervention thresholds in neonatal intensive care., Non Members, , Dr. Aparajita Chaudhary, dr.aparajita.ald@gmail.com, 7905788221, REGIONAL INSTITUTE OF OPHTHALMOLOGY MD eye Hospital  PRAYAGRAJ, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 00:19:47]

Many a times  inadvertent hand movements of the operator enlarges  the retinotomy or causes collateral damage. Hence the felt need for a safer system. Method:  We needed a device to avoid transmission of operator movement 2)  control delivery of precise volume 3) Controlled pace of drug delivery  4) avoid dead space in the system to reduce wastage 5) Should be inexpensive 6) Should be sterilisable To achieve above goals following are required :  1) use the VFI module of Vitrectomy machine 2) have the ability to use 1cc syringe to deliver small aliquots 3) ability to connect standard 39/41 Gauge cannula to the syringe  4) Sterilisable adapter that can load VFI module on one side and a syringe (1cc/2cc/others) on the other. After multiple trials we were able to construct such an adapter that matched all above requirements and is autoclavable  hence safely reusable.

RNFL thickness was assessed using spectral-domain OCT  and visual field defects were analyzed using standard automated perimetry (SAP). The correlation between RNFL thinning and visual field loss in different quadrants was statistically evaluated.  Results: A significant correlation was observed between RNFL thinning and visual field defects  particularly in the superior and inferior quadrants. Greater RNFL loss was associated with increased mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) in perimetric testing. The relationship was stronger in advanced stages of glaucoma compared to early-stage disease.  Conclusion: OCT-based RNFL analysis serves as a valuable tool in detecting and monitoring glaucomatous damage. The correlation with visual field defects highlights its role in early diagnosis and progression assessment  reinforcing its clinical utility in glaucoma management., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 10:52:42]

Normally  eye drop volume of less than 15 µl is sufficient to be clinically effective & maximal tear film concentration can be achieved with a drop of 15 ??. Average drop size of many commercially available topical medications was actually 39 µl with a range of 25.1 to 56.4   AIM: To find out the drop size of various preparation of anti-Glaucoma drugs available in the market.   METHODOLOGY • To calculate the drop size  3 vials of different brand of anti glaucoma drug were taken. • The entire contents of vials were counted & measured in a 5ml graduated caliberated cylinder. • Bottles should be held approximately at angle of 60 degree.   To Conclude Drop size of 15 µl is sufficient to be effective & greater than that will cause wastage of medication & increase in side effects. Drop sizes in commercially available antiglaucoma preparations vary from 29-68 µl  and it leads to lot of wastage and financial strain on patient and payer. So lot of generic preprations may be cheaper  But due to large drop size  they may end up being costlier., DOS Members, S-1114, DR.

His vision was 6/9P in right eye and 6/9 in left eye on presentation. Partial thickness laceration on left lower lid was present involving orbicularis oculi muscle. Another muscle deep laceration was present which was 2mm away from lateral canthus extending 3 mm below and 2mm till eyebrow. Patient was given intramuscular injection tetanus toxoid stat and anti-rabies serum and vaccine. Primary Laceration graft was deferred until completion of rabies vaccination and done after 10 days. Patient was diagnosed as a case of Left eye traumatic aponeurotic severe ptosis with poor levator function with good bell’s response. Results : Patient underwent primary laceration repair after completion of rabies vaccination after 10 days  further patient underwent ptosis repair under L.A (frontalis sling -sillicon surgery) after 1 month with good postoperative outcome Conclusion : Trauma can induce ptosis by a wide variety of mechanisms. Traumatic stretching or pulling of the lid is known to produce traumatic aponeurotic ptosis via disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis from the tarsal plate. According to the mechanism and severity of injury  the degree of ptosis may range from mild to severe  and MRD1 deficits may be transient or permanent which can be managed surgically to provide good visual outcome for the patient., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 14:30:51]

This is a hospital based prospective study conducted in department of ophthalmology at a tertiary care hospital in western up. Total 44 patients with diagnosed POAG fulfilling the inclusion exclusion criteria   underwent detailed ophthalmic examination and evaluation for glaucoma after obtaining an informed consent. Visual field examination was done using Humphrey visual field analyzer (zeiss company) and RNFL thickness was measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (Huvitz company). Visual field analysis and RNFL thickness are critical features used in diagnosis of glaucoma. The loss of Retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma can be reflected structurally as localized or diffuse thinning of RNFL and its measurement has  been well correlated with the functional damage in visual  field. So accordingly on the basis of  RNFL thickness we can predict visual field defect. Some patients having normal field and decreased RNFL thickness progressed to some kind of field defect over the period of six months  of which the superior arcuate defect is commonest. Thus early glaucomatous changes can be picked upon OCT.  , Non Members, , Dr. ALKA GUPTA, dralkag@gmail.com, 9412201639, LLTRM Medical College, Non Members, , Dr. LOKESH KUMAR SINGH, drlokeshgeorgian2000@yahoo.com, 9720070704, LLRM Medical College, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 15:08:02]

METHODS: A prospective  randomized interventional study was conducted in 30 patients with severe unilateral congenital ptosis and poor levator function (?4 mm) with MRD1 <1 mm. Patients with prior ptosis surgery  facial palsy  poor Bell’s phenomenon  myasthenia gravis  or severe dry eye were excluded. Group A underwent CPLA  while Group B received silicone sling surgery. Outcomes assessed at 3 months included MRD1  postoperative lagophthalmos  lid symmetry  and complications.  RESULTS: The mean preoperative MRD1 was -0.9 ± 0.84 mm in Group A and -0.13 ± 0.93 mm in Group B. Postoperatively  MRD1 improved to 2.66 ± 1.12 mm at 4 weeks and 1.90 ± 1.13 mm at 3 months in Group A  while Group B showed greater improvement (3.63 ± 0.54 mm at 4 weeks and 3.1 ± 0.91 mm at 3 months). Postoperative lagophthalmos in Group A was 3.03 ± 2.1 mm at 4 weeks and 2.1 ± 2.1 mm at 3 months  whereas in Group B  it was 2.80 ± 1.8 mm and 2.10 ± 1.90 mm  respectively. Group A had more complications like lash ptosis and lid scarring.  CONCLUSION: Silicone sling surgery showed better results in terms of MRD1  inter eye symmetry  and fewer complications. CPLA is a useful alternative where synthetic materials are unsuitable. Longer follow-up is needed to assess long-term outcomes. , DOS Members, , RUCHI GOEL, gruchi1970@gmail.com, 9811305645, guru nanak eye centre, DOS Members, , TANVI GAONKER, tanvi.gaonker@gmail.com, 9822134441, guru nanak eye centre, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 16:55:10]

Comprehensive glaucoma work-up was done  followed by the measurement of anterior chamber parameters – AOD (Angle Opening Distance) 500  AOD 750  TISA (Trabecular Iris Space Area) 500  TISA 750  LV (Lens Vault)  TIA (Trabecular Iris Angle) 500- in temporal quadrants using Cirrus HD-OCT.  RESULTS A total of 204 eyes -46 PACS  46 PAC  45 PACG  and 67 normal eyes- were analysed. Significant differences in the mean AOD 500  AOD 750  TISA 500  TISA 750 and TIA 500 was observed between all the groups except PACS and PAC. Pearson correlation coefficients of AOD 500  AOD 750  TISA 500  TISA 750  and TIA 500 versus the gonioscopic angle grading was 0.885  0.932  0.911  0.892  and 0.864  respectively  significant at the 0.01 level.  CONCLUSION We found that angle parameters differ significantly in angle closure disease patients compared with age-matched normals and in different stages of angle closure disease. Angle width estimated by gonioscopy correlated significantly with the angle parameters measured by AS-OCT.  While gonioscopy remains the gold standard  advancements in anterior chamber imaging offer an objective and reproducible approach to diagnosing angle closure. Future developments  such as deep learning algorithms  could further enhance diagnostic accuracy , DOS Members, A-7751, Dr. Monika Arora, mail.monikaarora@gmail.com, 9512312018, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  Sitapur, DOS Members, B-1010, DR.

Vitamin A plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the ocular surface and supporting visual function. This study aims to raise awareness of these ocular signs and the importance of timely intervention.  **Method:**   A comprehensive literature review was conducted  analyzing studies on the relationship between vitamin A deficiency and ocular health. Clinical case reports and observational studies were included to assess the various ocular manifestations  such as night blindness  xerophthalmia  keratomalacia  and conjunctival dryness.  **Result:**   The findings indicate that vitamin A deficiency significantly affects the ocular system  with the most common symptoms being night blindness and dryness of the conjunctiva. Xerophthalmia  characterized by dryness and thickening of the conjunctiva  is prevalent in regions with poor dietary intake of vitamin A. In severe cases  keratomalacia and permanent blindness can result if the deficiency is not addressed. Children and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to these ocular manifestations.  **Conclusion:**   Vitamin A deficiency is a major cause of preventable blindness  particularly in developing countries. Early identification and intervention through supplementation or dietary improvement can prevent irreversible ocular damage. Public health initiatives aimed at increasing awareness and improving vitamin A intake are critical in reducing the prevalence of these ocular manifestations and promoting overall eye health., DOS Members, S-902, Sumit Sachdeva, www.sumitsachdeva@rediffmail.com, 7015851836, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, DOS Members, R-583, Manisha Rathi, www.manisharathi@hotmail.com, 9813381899, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, Non Members, , Kanupriya Vij, Www.drkanupriyavij@gmail.com, 7973216953, RIO  PGIMS  ROHTAK, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 20:09:54]

This study aims to analyze the patterns  management approaches  and outcomes of eyelid lacerations resulting from RTAs.  Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients presenting with eyelid lacerations due to RTAs at a tertiary care center over a specified period. Data regarding patient demographics  mechanism of injury  extent of lid involvement  associated ocular and systemic injuries  surgical interventions  and postoperative outcomes were reviewed. Results: A total of 10 cases were included  with a male predominance (70%). The most common mode of injury was direct blunt trauma or sharp object impact during collisions. Upper lid involvement was seen in 50% of cases  lower lid in 20%  and combined lid injuries in 30%. Full-thickness lacerations accounted for 10% of cases  with 10% involving the canalicular system requiring specialized repair. Surgical management included layered closure  tarsal plate reconstruction  and canalicular stenting where necessary. Complications such as lid malposition  notching  and lagophthalmos were noted in 20% of cases  with satisfactory functional and cosmetic outcomes in 80% post-repair. Conclusion: Eyelid lacerations following RTAs present with varied severity and often require meticulous surgical repair for optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes. Early intervention  appropriate surgical techniques  and multidisciplinary management play a crucial role in ensuring good prognosis. Public awareness  protective eyewear  and adherence to traffic regulations can help reduce their incidence.

Methods This prospective study involved 20 male patients diagnosed with Eales’ disease  aged 18-40 years  matched with 20 healthy controls. All patients underwent laser photocoagulation and were evaluated at baseline  6 weeks  and 3 months post-treatment. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to measure MCT and CMT  and Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was assessed using the LogMAR scale. Data were analyzed for statistical significance between the Eales disease group and controls at each follow-up interval.  Results At baseline  patients with Eales’ disease showed significantly greater MCT compared to controls (338.80±46.74 µm vs. 299.80±20.69 µm  p < 0.01). Post-laser photocoagulation  MCT increased further at 6 weeks (343.25±44.79 µm) and 3 months (353.25±29.25 µm)  though this change was not statistically significant (p = 0.43 and p = 0.15  respectively). CMT in the Eales disease group remained similar to controls at all time points (baseline: 240.5±30.90 µm vs. 253.40±23.52 µm  p = 0.10). No significant changes were observed in BCVA between the two groups throughout the study.  Conclusion Although MCT increased post-laser photocoagulation in Eales disease patients  these changes were not clinically significant and did not impact visual acuity. The peripheral retinal involvement in Eales disease likely explains the lack of significant macular changes. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to explore the long-term effects on choroidal and macular thickness., DOS Members, , Dr. Meenakshi Thakar, meenakshithakar147@gmail.com, 9868001242, Guru Nanak Eye Centre  Maulana Azad Medical College, DOS Members, , Dr. Paromita Dutta, mitad.4@gmail.com, 9873319983, Guru Nanak Eye Centre  Maulana Azad Medical College, DOS Members, , Dr. Shruti Bhattacharya, shrutibhattacharya1993@gmail.com, 8384048869, Guru Nanak Eye Centre  Maulana Azad Medical College, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 21:23:15]

Posterior segment pathologies are critical components of these injuries  and early diagnosis is pivotal in reducing the disease burden. A comprehensive understanding of demography  injury mechanisms  clinical findings  management strategies  and outcomes can enhance prevention and treatment approaches. Methods: A tertiary care hospital-based retrospective study was done analyzing electronic medical records of patients with closed-globe injuries who presented between January 2022-January 2023. Variables studied included age  sex  literacy level  mechanism of injury  primary diagnosis  treatment approach  and posterior segment pathologies. Management and outcomes were evaluated based on medical and surgical interventions and visual prognosis. Results: 43 patients were included in the study predominantly consisting of males (84%)  with a mean age of 30.5 years  56% being illiterate. The common modes of these injuries were road traffic accidents (47%)  falls (23%)  and wood stick injuries (12%). At presentation  58% of patients exhibited severe visual impairment. Retinal detachment (46%)  traumatic optic neuropathy (21%)  and vitreous hemorrhage (14%) were common pathologies observed. 77% of treated patients experienced visual improvement after appropriate intervention.  Conclusion: This study underscores the epidemiology of closed-globe injuries and their impact on vision. Posterior segment pathologies such as retinal detachment  traumatic optic neuropathy  and vitreous hemorrhage were relatively more common. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial  directly translating to better visual outcomes. Future efforts should focus on preventive strategies and optimizing surgical interventions to enhance visual prognosis. , DOS Members, SD-1701, Dr. INDRANIL SAHA, INDRANIL124SAHA@YAHOO.CO.IN, 8826239971, Regional Institute of Ophthalmology  Sitapur, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-03-31 21:45:23]

To study the prevalence  risk factors & clinical profile of the computer vision syndrome among college going students. Methods : This study is a cross-sectional observational study conducted among college-going students to determine the prevalence  risk factors  and clinical manifestations of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). The study was carried out in the Department of Ophthalmology at the National Institute of Medical Science and Research  Jaipur. The target population for this study will be college-going students  specifically medical and engineering students at NIMS University  Jaipur  who have a screen time of more than 3 hours per day. Results : Headache was more prevalent among engineering students  with only 35.1% reporting no symptoms compared to 55.2% of medical students. Burning eye sensation was also more common among engineering students  with only 45.5% reporting no symptoms compared to 65.7% of medical students. Eye redness was significantly more prevalent among engineering students  with 45.5% reporting no symptoms compared to 84.3% in medical students. Dry eyes were reported less frequently among medical students  with 70.1% experiencing no symptoms compared to 39.6% of engineering students.  Conclusion : This study benefits from a balanced and diverse sample of engineering and medical students  enabling a direct comparison of Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) symptoms between two academic disciplines with different digital engagement patterns. The reliance on self-reported data introduces the potential for recall bias  as participants may not accurately estimate their screen time or symptom severity.   , DOS Members, M-2857, DR.

Acute leukemia is more likely to cause ocular involvement in comparison to chronic leukemia. They may be the presenting feature  sign of relapse or develop after diagnosis of leukemia. These can occur due to primary/direct leukemic infiltration of ocular tissues or secondary/ indirect involvement. Here  we present a case series of patients with leukemia having ocular manifestations. The patients had leukemic retinopathy with retinal haemorrhages  1 patient had leukemic infiltration of the optic nerve  1 presented with pseudohypopyon as a relapse of leukemia and 1 had CMV retinitis. Hence  this paper emphasizes the need for routine ophthalmic evaluation of the known cases of leukemia to detect life threatening manifestations and the progression of the disease at a hastened pace to allow for early and prompt treatment., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-01 00:27:13]

To evaluate the change in generation of causative agents and their antibiotic sensitivity and resistance patterns. Materials & Methods A retrospective analysis of the demo graphic  clinical  and microbiological data was performed in 100 consecutive patients with infectious keratitis. The main parameters evaluated were nature of first contact with the health care services  investigations undertaken  treatment initiated  and the time interval between presentation to the first medical contact and to our center. Finally  the reports of culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing undertaken at our center were evaluated. All these parameters were compared with out previous study conducted 25 years back. Results  In 85.9% of cases  ophthalmologists in independent practice were the first medical contact which is comparatively higher than our previous studies (p-0.0068) Forty-six percent of the patients were prescribed 0.3% ciprofloxacin eyedrops in the previous whereas 50% received moxifloxacin eye drops. Frequency of antibiotics prescribed at the first contact was inadequate in all of the cases whereas it is adequate in 44% of cases (p- 0.0001) Broad-spectrum fortified antibiotics eye drops had not been prescribed in any of the cases in previous study whereas 13% received fortified antibiotics (p- 0.0001). Conclusion: Use of fortified antibiotics at the first contact has been increased without culture.

The presence of a cyclitic membrane  anterior chamber abnormalities  and keratic precipitates were identified. The delayed presentation and lack of timely medical intervention were noted as contributing factors to disease progression.  Results  The patient  a 21-year-old female  was diagnosed with chronic anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis) complicated by cataract formation. She experienced progressive vision loss over 1.5 years  along with recurrent episodes of redness for five years. Ophthalmic evaluation revealed non-reactive pupils with occlusiopupillae  a shallow anterior chamber  and ultrasound findings confirming the attachment of the ciliary body to the lens capsule. The presence of old keratic precipitates further suggested prolonged inflammation. Due to delayed diagnosis and intervention  the visual prognosis remained poor despite medical and surgical management.  Conclusion  This case highlights the critical role of early detection and timely intervention in managing chronic anterior uveitis. Delayed reporting of symptoms can lead to severe complications such as complicated cataracts and irreversible visual impairment.

Lifitegrast 5% is a novel lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) antagonist that reduces ocular inflammation  a key component of DED pathophysiology. This study evaluates the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of Lifitegrast 5% eye drops compared to Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) 1% in patients with moderate to severe DED at a tertiary care center in North India.  Methods A prospective  comparative  randomized study was conducted on 104 patients (52 per group) diagnosed with moderate to severe DED. Participants were assessed at Baseline  2 Weeks  8 Weeks  and 12 Weeks using validated clinical parameters: Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)  Tear Breakup Time (TFBUT)  Schirmer’s Test I  Corneal Fluorescein Staining  Conjunctival Redness Score  and Eye Dryness Score (EDS). Adverse events and patient-reported side effects were monitored for safety evaluation. Statistical analysis included independent t-tests  chi-square tests  and repeated measures ANOVA for within-group and between-group comparisons.  Conclusions Preliminary results indicate that Lifitegrast 5% significantly improves DED symptoms and clinical parameters compared to CMC 1%  with superior outcomes in OSDI scores  TFBUT  and corneal staining reduction. Lifitegrast was well tolerated  with mild  transient adverse effects such as burning sensation and dysgeusia in some patients. These findings suggest that Lifitegrast 5% is an effective and safe therapeutic option for moderate to severe DED  providing long-term symptom relief and ocular surface protection. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm these benefits., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-01 14:49:17]

There was no literature on management of such a large haemangioma of upper eye lid. After lot of deliberation two stage surgical dissection was planned. METHOD STEP 1- Dissection of anterior lamella from anterior surface The extra large tumor consisting of skin  vascular tissue and fibrous tissue  anterior lamella was excised in toto from anterior surface.  STEP 2-Dissection of Posterior lamella from conjunctival surface The hypertrophied posterior lamella consisting of tarsal plate  mullers muscles and conjunctiva was dissected and excised from posterior surface leaving lid margins intact. RESULTAppearanceAfter 1 Month Post operative aesthetic appearance of the young girl was good. The hypertrophied adjacent tissue started shrinking. Post op upper eye lid movements  eyeball movements became normal. Suppressed Visual acuity of left eye recovered gradually. Conclusion Unnecessary delay in excision of large size haemangioma may lead to hypertrophy of adjacent tissue and suppression of their function.

Grade 3 ptosis  representing severe eyelid drooping  can significantly impair vision and quality of life. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges for a young adult presenting with these symptoms. Case Presentation: The patient reported a 10 year history of gradually worsening ptosis and weakness of extraocular movements. Ophthalmological examination revealed significant bilateral upper eyelid ptosis  not affecting visual field  frontalis overaction  head tilt and restricted extraocular movements.Investigations  including routine bloodwork and imaging  were unremarkable. Histopathological studies  specifically electromyography (EMG)  demonstrated findings consistent with mitochondrial myopathy disorder  specifically  features suggestive of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Conclusion:  This case highlights the importance of considering mitochondrial disorders in young adults presenting with progressive ptosis and ophthalmoplegia  even in the absence of other systemic manifestations. It also emphasizes the role of electrophysiological  testing in establishing a definitive diagnosis in such complex presentations., Non Members, , Dr Vedika Goyal, vedikagoyal650@gmail.com, 8764076001, Civil Hospital Faridabad , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-01 22:15:31]

CASE HISTORY FINDINGS A 30-year-old male with a history of blurred vision in his right eye for 2 months  presented best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/60 associated with image distortion. There was no history of systemic diseases. The patient underwent fundus examination  optical coherence tomography (OCT)  and B-scan ultrasonography. A yellowish to orange-colored subretinal elevated mass with well-defined margins was observed. On B-scan imaging  the osteoma appeared as a slightly elevated  dense choroidal mass  highly reflective at both high and low scanning sensitivities. On OCT  there was disruption of the outer retina with a subfoveal homogeneous hyporeflective area suggestive of subretinal fluid.After three intravitreal injections of ranibizumab  the patient improved to a BCVA of 20/30 and partial resolution of subretinal fluid.  CONCLUSION Choroidal osteoma is a benign lesion that causes vision loss due to calcification in the subretinal space and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Treatment focuses on managing CNV and resolving subretinal fluid  with anti-VEGF injections proving effective. Vision improvement depends on lesion characteristics  CNV  and subretinal fluid. Long-term follow-up is crucial for monitoring and recurrence. , DOS Members, MD-1471, DR.

Purpose: To evaluate the differences in Central Macular Thickness (CMT)  Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer (RNFL) thickness and Retinal Vascular Density (RVD) between pre and post-treatment amblyopic eyes. Methods: Subjects aged 4-12 years with unilateral amblyopia underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCTA) before and after occlusion therapy for 3 months. Results: The mean age of subjects was 9.27?±?2.50 years. After amblyopia treatment  there was no significant improvement in BCVA of amblyopic eyes (p>0.05). However  the CMT and mean RNFL thickness decreased (p= 0.002 and p=0.011) and RVD values of SCP (p=0.047) and DCP (p=0.035) increased after amblyopia therapy. Conclusion: The retinal structural and microvascular changes may precede the functional outcome of the treatment. Thus  OCT and OCTA can be used to correlate these changes with functional improvement in patients undergoing amblyopia therapy., DOS Members, R-277, Dr. ANJU RASTOGI, dranjurastogi@yahoo.co.in, 9818340924, Maulana Azad Medical College , DOS Members, G-8279, Dr. KASHISH Garg, kashishgarg.kg@gmail.com, 9988313031, Maulana Azad Medical College , DOS Members, UD-2023, Dr.  Umesh, 22494drumesh@gmail.com, 8802393391, Maulana Azad Medical College , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-01 23:46:37]

Methods: 6 month  non-randomized  prospective study evaluating visual acuity  IOL tilt and decentration following implantation of Sutureless Foldable Scleral-Fixated IOLs in 21 eyes with inadequate zonulo-capsular support (eyes having surgical aphakia or high degree of ectopia lentis). Results: UCVA improved from logMAR 1.49 ± 0.33 (range : 0.78 - 1.78) to logMAR 0.63 ± 0.31 (range : 0.18 - 1.18) after implantation of Sutureless Foldable Scleral-Fixated IOLs with mean IOL tilt of 4.56° and mean decentration 0.36 mm. UCVA before surgery was worse than 20/200 in 85% of eyes. Post-operatively  UCVA was better than or equivalent to preoperatively determined BCVA in 90% of eyes. After IOL implantation  UCVA was 20/60 or better in 38% of eyes and 20/200 or better in 85% of eyes. Conclusion: At 6 months  Sutureless Foldable Scleral-Fixated IOL implantation  in eyes with inadequate zonulo-capsular support (where implantation of in-the-bag IOLs is not possible)  provides significant gain in UCVA with minimal IOL tilt and decentration while avoiding the suture related complications of sutured SF-IOLs., DOS Members, R-277, Dr. ANJU RASTOGI, dranjurastogi@yahoo.co.in, 9818340924, Maulana Azad Medical College, DOS Members, SD-2174, Dr. Meghna Sethi, meghnasethi25@gmail.com, 9560601175, Maulana Azad Medical College, DOS Members, UD-2023, Dr.  Umesh, 22494drumesh@gmail.com, 8802393391, Maulana Azad Medical College, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-02 00:00:02]

Methods: This comparative  interventional study included diabetic patients undergoing phacoemulsification. Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving IVTA at the time of surgery and the other undergoing cataract surgery alone. Central macular thickness (CMT) and IOP were measured preoperatively and at follow-up visits using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and Goldmann applanation tonometry  respectively. Statistical analysis was performed to compare changes in CMT and IOP between the two groups.  Results: The study included 48 eyes of 48 patients divided into two groups: phacoemulsification with IVTA (cases) and stand-alone phacoemulsification (controls). Baseline parameters were comparable. The IVTA group showed a significant CMT reduction at 1 month (p=0.027)  which diminished by 3 months  highlighting its transient anti-inflammatory effect. IOP was significantly higher in the IVTA group at 1 week and 1 month (p=0.0003  p=0.005) but normalized by 3 months  with no cases of IOP >21 mmHg. Both groups had comparable visual improvements  and no progression in diabetic retinopathy was observed  confirming the safety of phacoemulsification in diabetic patients.  Conclusion  Low-dose IVTA effectively reduces the risk of postoperative CMT increase in diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery  potentially minimizing the progression of DME. Although a transient IOP elevation was noted  it remained within safe limits without requiring long-term intervention. IVTA may be considered as a prophylactic adjunct  in selected diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery to enhance visual outcomes.

It assesses the impact of both procedures on Margin Reflex Distance 1 (MRD1) and evaluates outcomes using objective (MRD1 improvement) and subjective (patient satisfaction scale) measures. The goal is to determine the efficacy and cosmetic advantages of each technique.  Methods: A total of 20 patients with mild to moderate ptosis were randomized into two groups: one undergoing MMCR and the other Levator Plication. Preoperative assessments included history-taking  visual acuity testing  MRD1 measurement  and levator function evaluation. Additional tests such as slit-lamp examination  the phenylephrine test  and fatigue testing were performed to identify suitable candidates. Surgical outcomes were monitored postoperatively at four intervals—on the 3rd day  10th day  end of the 1st month  and at the 3rd month. Functional improvement was assessed based on MRD1 changes  while patient satisfaction was recorded through a subjective grading scale.  Conclusion: MMCR was found to be as effective as Levator Plication in terms of functional and cosmetic outcomes in mild to moderate ptosis. However  MMCR is preferable as it is a transconjunctival procedure  avoiding external scarring associated with Levator Plication. Given its comparable efficacy and superior cosmetic outcome  MMCR is recommended as a viable alternative for selected cases of ptosis.

However  steroid-induced glaucoma typically refers to that caused by exogenous corticosteroid administration. Glaucoma secondary to endogenous overproduction of corticosteroids has only been reported in a few case reports. We aim to bring attention to glaucoma as a rare but important manifestation of endogenous hypercortisolism. Methods: Patient history  physical exam  laboratory results  and imaging studies were reviewed. Results: We report a case of glaucoma as the initial presentation of Cushing disease (CD). The patient was diagnosed with glaucoma 16 months prior to his endocrinology evaluation. At our initial encounter  the patient had a cushingoid appearance. Levels of 24-hour urinary cortisol and late-night salivary cortisol were elevated. Serum cortisol was not suppressed by 1 mg of dexamethasone overnight  but it was suppressed by 8 mg of dexamethasone. Adrenocorticotropic hormone was also elevated. All other pituitary hormone axes were unremarkable (thyroidstimulating hormone  free thyroxine  follicle-stimulating hormone  luteinizing hormone  growth hormone  prolactin  and insulin-like growth factor). Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging suggested a small adenoma (2 to 3 mm)  therefore  the patient underwent inferior petrosal sinus sampling. The results were consistent with CD. Transsphenoidal resection was performed and final pathology confirmed an adrenocorticotropic hormone-positive adenoma. Hypercortisolism and intraocular pressures improved after the surgery. Conclusion: Glaucoma can lead to irreversible blindness if left untreated or uncontrolled. However  endogenous hypercortisolism-induced glaucoma can be reversed with treatment of the underlying CD. Thus  heightened awareness of extraocular manifestations of secondary causes of glaucoma such as endogenous hypercortisolism is necessary in order to promote prompt evaluation and treatment, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-03 15:30:37]

These issues are particularly pressing among women due to a lack of general knowledge  inaccessibility to education and health care and underrepresentation Method :A cross sectional study was carried out in which a total of 150 female patients were included who were visiting the out patient department of ophthalmology in the Government medical college of Ratlam. The responses were recorded on a pre designed and pre tested  questionnaire. Following the initial response  health education and counselling was provided to all the participants and they were re- assessed after one month using same questionnaire. Result :Initial responses revealed nutritional deficiency(70%)  congenital issues(51%) and bad eye care(60%) to be the most common reasons of low vision. Refusal to use spectacles stemmed from cosmetic concerns(70%)  hindrances in marriage(61%)  teasing from colleagues(20%). Health education and counselling brought about statistically significant changes in the knowledge  attitude and behavior regarding spectacle use.

According to a survey conducted by the WHO and NPCB (National Programme for Control of Blindness)  India has a backlog of over 22 million blind eyes and 12 million blind persons  80.1% of whom are blind as a result of cataract. Objective: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of topical NSAIDs in combination with topical corticosteroids versus topical corticosteroids alone in controlling intraocular inflammation after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Methodology: Totally  100 patients undergoing phacoemulsification with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation were randomly assigned to receive either nepafenac 0.1% 3 times daily plus 1% prednisolone eye drops for 1 month or 1% prednisolone eye drops only as their postoperative anti-inflammatory medication with 50 cases in each group. The patients were examined at the 1st day (baseline)  1st week  2nd week  and 4th week after surgery. Postoperative inflammation was evaluated subjectively by intraocular pressure  slit-lamp assessment of signs of inflammation  including conjunctival hyperemia  ocular pain  and aqueous cells and flare. Result & Conclusion: We would want to draw the conclusion that there were no differences between groups randomly allocated to Corticosteroid monotherapy or combination treatment with NSAID & steroid in treating early inflammation following cataract surgery.

Methods: To evaluate the diagnostic techniques  emergency management protocols  and surgical interventions used in the treatment of penetrating eye injuries. Conclusion:Penetrating eye injuries represent a significant cause of visual morbidity and are often associated with complex ocular trauma that can lead to permanent vision loss if not promptly and properly managed. These injuries frequently result from occupational hazards  accidents  or assaults  and they demand immediate and specialized medical attention. Early diagnosis  meticulous wound repair  and appropriate use of antibiotics and surgical interventions play a pivotal role in preserving ocular function and preventing complications such as endophthalmitis  retinal detachment  or sympathetic ophthalmia. Long-term visual prognosis depends on several factors including the extent and location of the injury  presence of intraocular foreign bodies  and the timeliness of care., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-05 16:20:40]

Results : The mass was initially small in size showing gradual painless enlargement . On examination there was no fluctuation in the size of the mass with Valsalva maneuver or exercise. Palapation of the mass revealed a firm  well circumscibed   not fixed to the overlying skin  freely mobile subcutaneous mass.  On CT scan a hyperdense  well circumscibed lesion in the left orbit in close contact with the superior rectus muscle with no evidence of bony attachment and no orbital extension was noted. Surgical excisional biopsy of the mass was planned and sample was sent for histopathological examination which showed dilated thick spaces with a single layer of endothelium loaded with blood cells and areas of thrombosis. There was a hypercellular stroma and a well defined capsule. All these findings were consistent with Cavernous hemangioma. Conclusion: Cavernous venous malformation may occur superficially in the eyelid  and it must be considered in the differential diagnosis for any well-defined eyelid tumor. Other diagnoses should be accurately ruled of by a proper examination of the mass and relevant investigations  including imaging and histopathology. A well-circumscribed cavernous venous malformation of the eyelid can easily be excised and should be followed by a histopathologic analysis to rule out any malignant component., Non Members, , Dr. Meghna Saxena, Saxenameghna30@gmail.com, 7838307226, Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College Jhansi, Non Members, , Dr. Devanshi Yadav, shristiagarwal077@gmail.com, 7417355570, Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College Jhansi , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-05 23:22:51]

Aims and Objective : To detect changes in macular  foveal  and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness following occlusion therapy using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in children with unilateral anisometropic amblyopia between age group 5-18 years. Methods :  •	Only those patients fulfilling inclusion criteria are further investigated retinoscopy. •	Fundus examination  for each eye with  IO using  20?D  condensing lens  following a pupillary dilation. •	Following retinoscopy  thickness of macular  foveal  and retinal nerve fiber layer accessed via OCT on every 3 visit in duruaton April 2024 to march 2025. Results: The study found that macular thickness (MT) and foveal thickness (FT) were greater in amblyopic eyes compared to normal fellow eyes and normal eyes of healthy children. However  these thicknesses decreased with improvements in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) following occlusion therapy. In contrast  retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) showed no significant differences between amblyopic eyes  normal fellow eyes  and normal eyes of healthy children  both before and after occlusion therapy. These findings suggest that occlusion therapy may help restore the postnatal reduction process of ganglion cells  as evidenced by the reduction in MT and FT observed on optical coherence tomography (OCT). However  further larger-scale studies are needed to address the limitations of the current study and validate these results., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-05 23:24:02]

Methods : 29 yr old female patient presented with the chief complaint of  mass in left eye since childhood. Results : The case report presents a painless mass growth in left eye  of young female patient. It was accompanied with facial disfigurement. On clinical examination of left eye  there was a firm  well circumscibed  mass of size (2*2)mm on infero temporal quadrant of corneoscleral junction/limbus with associated hair follicle. On orbital CT scan a superficial soft tissue swelling at limbus in lower and outer quadrant of left eye showing HU of +47 likely benign etiology with no internal calcification and deeper invasion was reported. Surgical excisional biopsy of the mass was planned and sample was sent for histopathological examination which showed tissue lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Underlying zone showed fibrocartilagenous tissue with interspersed hair follicles alongwith dialted and congested blood vessels suggestive of choristomatous tissue. All these findings were consistent with epibulbar choristoma(limbal dermoid).  Conclusion:  Limbal dermoid is benign tumor on corneoscleral junction that contain choristomatous tissue. Other diagnoses should be accurately ruled out by a proper examination of the mass and relevant investigations  including imaging and histopathology. A limbal dermoid can be medically managed or excised in presence of suitable indiactions.

DR is one of the leading causes of vision impairment among individuals with diabetes and is closely linked to poor glycemic control. Studies have shown a strong association between elevated HbA1c levels and the severity of DR  highlighting the importance of maintaining optimal blood sugar levels. The study was aimed for clinical significance of optical coherence tomography in diagnosis of diabetic macular edema and its correlation with HbA1c levels Material and Methods : This prospective observational study was conducted at Department of Ophthalmology  MLB Medical College Jhansi on 80 patients with diabetic macular edema . All patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation  including best-corrected visual acuity  intraocular pressure measurement  and dilated fundus examination along with HbA1c measurements. Statistical analysis was performed included chi-square tests  independent t-tests  and analysis of variance (ANOVA)  with P-values < 0.05 considered significant.  Results : The mean age of the cases was 51.2±7.45 yrs. Majority of the cases were males. In 46.25% of cases  the duration of diabetes >10 yrs. Mean baseline HbA1c level was 8.56±1.10gm/dL. As the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy increases  the mean CMT also increases. The difference was found to be statistically significant.HbA1c level decreases with different time interval CMT also decreases.   Conclusion : The study highlights that uncontrolled glycemic level  longer diabetes duration  and the presence of macular edema are key factors associated with the severity of DR. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-06 11:14:59]

Methods: A total of 100 patients (age 41-60 years  mean age 53.46±5.33 years  73% males) were enrolled in the study after ruling out pre-existing dry eye. All the cases underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Duration of surgery  amount of cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) and fluid used was noted. All the patients were followed up postoperatively at Day 1  7 and 30 for evaluation of dry eye using Tear Break Up Time (TBUT)  Schirmer’s I-test  ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and corneal fluorescein screening (CFS). Data was analyzed using Paired ‘t’-  Independent samples ‘t’  Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Mean duration of surgery  CDE and fluid used were 14.40±1.70 minutes  9.25±2.15 %-s and 128.80±16.04 ml respectively. Using different tests  incidence of dry eye at Day 1  7 and 30 was 15%  66% and 11% respectively. During the study period overall incidence of dry eye was 71%. Incidence of dry eye did not show a significant association with sex. However  older age  longer duration of surgery  higher amount of CDE and fluid used were found to be significantly associated with higher incidence of dry eye. Conclusion: The findings of the study showed that dry eye following phacoemulsification is a transient phenomenon which do not persist for long and normalizes within one month. Intraoperative factors seem to have a role in influencing this incidence, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-06 11:21:28]

At the same time  this study evaluates whether disease activity in Thyroid Eye Disease can be accurately assessed by 2 scale method of exophthalmometry along with other clinical parameters and compares it with exophthalmos measured on CT scan of orbit to find out extent of correlation existing between them.   Methods: A cross sectional analytical clinical study was conducted over 20 months (July 2023 to February 2025) in the Department of Ophthalmology  Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College and Hospital  Jhansi  Uttar Pradesh on patients attending the Ophthalmology OPD who met the inclusion criteria. Detailed ocular examinations  including proptosis evaluation (by 2 scale method)  were performed. Thyroid Profile  USG B-scan of eye and CT scan orbit for exophthalmometry and EOM belly thickness measurement were advised to all the patients. Data were collected and analyzed that showed detailed demographic profile of TED in bundelkhand region. Our study shows that clinical parameters assessment along with exophthalmometry has diagnostic accuracy comparable to B-scan of eye and orbital CT scan for assessing disease activity in TED. It also shows that significant correlation exist between clinical and objective assessment tools.   Conclusion: Orbital CT and B-scan of eye is an effective non-invasive imaging technique for assessing activity in TED but clinical assessment is of paramount importance. So  diagnostic approach in a case of TED should include meticulous clinical workup followed by radiological diagnosis. This protocol ensures costeffectiveness  early diagnosis and tailored management plan. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-06 13:26:30]

These digital devices have a propensity to produce a variety of systemic  visual  and ocular problems. The goal of this study was to determine whether there was any correlation between different ocular  visual  and systemic symptoms and the frequency of using digital devices. Materials and Methods: An online Google questionnaire consisting of demographic information and pre tested questionnaires of symptoms related was distributed using social platforms. Results: The majority of the participants (65.66%) were utilising their digital gadgets for more than six hours each day during lockdown. 2 digital gadgets were being used by 49% of the respondents. The number of hours spent using digital devices during lockdown was positively correlated with ocular symptoms as wet eyes (P = 0.002)  dry eyes (P = 0.006)  and hurting eyes (P = 0.011). Similar to this  neck pain and shoulder pain were the main systemic symptoms linked to increasing hours spent using digital devices (P = 0.000 and P = 0.009  respectively). Conclusion: Increasing exposure to the multiple digital devices have negative impact on ocular and systemic symptoms. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-06 20:18:00]

Subfoveal deposits of hard exudates can lead to worse visual outcomes by preventing interaction between the retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer. In addition  severe prolonged subfoveal hard exudates can cause sub retinal fibrosis  resulting in permanent visual loss .Therefore   rapid hard exudates resorption is required in cases with centre involvement. Until now  there have been no treatment guidelines for this pathology  and unfortunately  hard exudates have often gone unresolved with scant or no recovery for the patient. In this study we will delve the role of primary vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling for diabetic macular edema with subfoveal plaque like hard exudates.  , Non Members, , Dr Sangeet Mittal , sangeetmittal@rediffmail.com, 8629018363, Thind Eye Hospital , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-06 21:17:30]

Method: We report a case series of three patients with persistent eyelid symptoms initially diagnosed and treated as meibomitis or blepharitis but without improvement. Results: Case 1: A 12-year-old female presented with recurrent eyelid swelling  itching  and facial rash. Initially managed as chalazion/meibomian gland dysfunction  she showed no improvement over 3 months. Biopsy and systemic investigations revealed eyelid tuberculosis—anti-tubercular therapy led to complete resolution. Case 2: A 40-year-old male had unilateral eyelid swelling for 2 months  unresponsive to treatment. Further evaluation diagnosed Rosai-Dorfman disease localised to the eyelid. He responded to intralesional triamcinolone injections. Case 3: A 13-year-old female with longstanding lid margin inflammation was repeatedly treated for bilateral blepharitis without relief. She also developed posterior subcapsular cataracts from chronic steroid use. She was eventually diagnosed with lipoid proteinosis  a rare  benign  untreatable condition.

Agarwal Trophy Cornea Session , Cornea & Ocular Surface, DMEK - Journey of a beginner, , Aim: To describe a beginner’s journey of learning descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK)   Methods: In my quest to learn DMEK  I practiced 25 graft preparations on not suitable for surgery corneal tissues. I faced multiple challenges during practice tissue preparations like tearing of graft  smaller than intended graft etc. I also tried injecting the graft in a artificial anterior chamber  with it’s own set of problems.   I share the outcomes of the first 18 cases that I performed.   Results: The indications of DMEK in the ten cases  were non-resolving corneal edema secondary to pseudophakic bullous keratopathy  Fuch’s endothelial corneal dystrophy  toxic anterior segment syndrome  Descemet’s membrane detachment and Viral endothelitis. 27% patients required a rescue descemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK). Rejection was seen in one patient. Detachment requiring rebubbling was required in one patient. Post-operative high intraocular pressure (IOP) was noted in three patients. The complications that needed conversion to DSEK were  unfolding of graft in anterior chamber due to blood soakage at the wound site during injection  poor visibility for graft opening after descemet’s membrane stripping and the graft getting lost after injection.  Conclusion: DMEK has a steep learning curve  and many challenges and complications can be faced both in the intra-operative and post-operative period. But despite that  it is possible to learn to perform the surgery. As per the assessment of my cases  I have seen improvement in execution with each passing case  and decrease in the time taken to perform the surgery , Non Members, , Vikas Mittal, isha.chaudhari@sceh.net, 9996441555, L.J Eye institute, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-07 17:56:36]

This case series highlights the significance of early identification and management of retained foreign bodies to prevent secondary infections and inflammatory responses. Body: A patient with a history of orbital trauma initially underwent primary repair but presented later with persistent orbital swelling  pain  and restricted ocular motility. Imaging revealed an undiagnosed retained foreign body embedded within the orbit  leading to chronic inflammation  conjunctival granuloma formation  and pre-septal cellulitis. Surgical exploration and foreign body removal led to significant clinical improvement. We present 2 cases of trauma   road traffic accident with orbital fractures and with retained foreign body which due to delayed diagnosis caused spike in orbital inflammation and infection.  Conclusion: These cases underscores the importance of thorough clinical evaluation and imaging in all cases of orbital trauma. A missed foreign body can trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses  predisposing patients to chronic orbital infections  fibrosis  and potential vision loss. Early intervention through high-resolution imaging and meticulous surgical exploration is critical in preventing such complications. This report aims to emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion in trauma cases  advocating for a comprehensive approach to minimize long-term morbidity and ensure optimal patient outcomes.

Methods: A known case of Fuch’s endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) with with immature senile cahad undergone combined cataract surgery with decemet’s stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) one-year back. The presenting best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/60 in the left eye and she was planned for DMEK with cataract surgery for the left eye. During surgery  the lenticule was prepared and loaded in a Geuder’s cannula for injection. Cataract surgery was performed with a scleral incision  an intraocular lens was placed  descemet’s membrane stripping was done. Each time an attempt was made to inject the graft  the anterior chamber became shallow. The graft was finally injected in the fourth attempt  however immediately after injection the iris prolapsed and the graft could not be visualized. Multiple attempts were made to search behind the iris and the drain pouch was also carefully looked at to find the lenticule but it couldn’t be found. The case was closed.  Results: A DSEK lenticule was placed in the eye two days later. The patient is doing well post-operatively.  Conclusion: DMEK surgery has a steep learning curve and many problems can be faced while performing the surgery. In the initial stages of the learning curve it is important to use syringes that are smooth and don’t inject with a jerk  have an appropriate incision size and have a DSEK tissue back up in case the graft is lost., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-08 00:20:30]

Clinical examination revealed lid edema  restricted ocular movements  conjunctival ballooning  and sub-conjunctival air cavities with palpable crepitus. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of air in the preseptal  extraconal  and intraconal orbital compartments. Emergency surgical intervention was performed  including orbital decompression with needle aspiration  lateral canthotomy  and cantholysis  followed by securing corneal wound . A repeat suture and air descmetopexy was performed two weeks later due to a large persistent DMD. After 4 weeks of follow up  patient regained BCVA 6/36(PH) with persistent mild edema Result: This is the first case ever been reported in literature having orbital emphysema post C3 F8 descmetopexy . Timely orbital decompression  measures prevented permanent vision loss. Subsequently suture assisted air descemetopexy. helped the patient to regain vision of 6/36 (PH). Conclusion: Orbital emphysema is a potentially vision-threatening but preventable complication of gas-assisted anterior chamber procedures. This case emphasizes the importance of using the correct concentration of C3F8 gas and cautious technique during injection.

The focus is on assessing the effectiveness of this combined approach in improving patient outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included 34 patients who underwent combined silicone oil removal and cataract extraction between May 2019 and August 2021. The primary outcomes measured were best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  intraocular pressure (IOP)  and the rate of postoperative complications  including retinal detachment. The study analyzed the visual outcomes and refractive status before and after the combined procedure. Results: The mean age of the patients was 52.18 years. The most common indication for vitrectomy was tractional retinal detachment due to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The mean duration of silicone oil tamponade was approximately 8.09 months. Post-surgery  32.35% of patients achieved a BCVA of 6/60 or better  demonstrating the effectiveness of the combined procedure. , DOS Members, J-8579, Dr. Soumya Jainer, soumyajainer@gmail.com, 9877117391, , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-08 21:02:55]

Method: We present a case of a 26-year-old healthy male  with no prior medical history  referred for a painless swelling at the lower lid medially for the past 11 years. The soft compressible non-pulsatile cystic swelling was noticed soon after blunt trauma and recurred after cyst aspiration done elsewhere. No complaint of epiphora  no increase in size on Valsalva noted. The cyst increased in size while syringing though syringing was freely patent from both puncta. CT DCG showed presence of dye in cystic mass in the inferomedial orbit communicating with lacrimal system.   Result: Following complete excision of the lesion  histopathology revealed an apocrine hidrocystoma.   Conclusion: Although rare and more common along the eyelid margin  apocrine hidrocystomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis for cystic mass of the orbit at any age group. , DOS Members, G-8022, Dr. SHIRALI GOKHARU, gokharu.shirali@gmail.com, 7697072331, , DOS Members, K-5816, Dr. NAMITA KUMARI, dr.namitajnmc@gmail.com, 7895698577, Dr Shroffs Charity Eye Hospital, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-09 10:37:00]

We present a case of a 6-month-old baby girl who was diagnosed with CRS and congenital cataract. The baby presented with bilateral cataract and was found to have rubella-specific IgM antibodies  confirming the diagnosis of CRS. Further evaluation revealed additional features of CRS  including hearing loss and developmental delays. This case highlights the importance of considering CRS in the differential diagnosis of congenital cataract  particularly in regions with low vaccination rates. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing the complications of CRS and improving outcomes for affected children. This case report aims to raise awareness about CRS and its ocular manifestations  as well as the need for comprehensive evaluation and management of children with congenital cataract.  Method  Congenital Rubella Syndrome is a preventable condition that can have devastating consequences for affected children.

We present a case of bilateral optic atrophy caused by a space-occupying lesion  highlighting the diagnostic challenges and importance of prompt intervention. Method   A 45-year-old male presented with progressive bilateral vision loss over six months. Fundoscopic examination revealed bilateral optic disc pallor  and visual acuity was limited to hand motion in both eyes. MRI revealed a suprasellar mass compressing the optic chiasm and nerves. The lesion was identified as a meningioma  and the patient underwent surgical resection.  *Discussion*  Space-occupying lesions  such as meningiomas  can cause bilateral optic atrophy by compressing the optic nerves or chiasm. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible vision loss. Our case highlights the importance of considering compressive optic neuropathy in patients with progressive vision loss. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that prompt surgical intervention can lead to improved visual outcomes.  *Conclusion*  Bilateral optic atrophy due to space-occupying lesions requires prompt recognition and treatment to preserve vision. This case report and literature review emphasize the need for clinicians to consider compressive optic neuropathy in patients with progressive vision loss and underscore the importance of timely intervention to optimize outcomes., Non Members, , Dr Ruchi Dabas, dabas.ruchi@yahoo.co.in, 83969 12507, RIO PGIMS, Non Members, , Dr. Manisha Nada, manisha_nada@rediffmail.com, 9896007158, RIO PGIMS, Non Members, , Dr. Jitender Phogat , drjitenderphogat@gmail.com, 9813588757, RIO PGIMS, Non Members, , Dr. Mamta Verma, drmsverma24@gmail.com, 93063 55472, RIO PGIMS, 2025-04-09 15:52:04]

This rare pathogen  previously associated with keratitis and systemic infections  has not been previously identified as a causative agent of postoperative endophthalmitis. Our case involves a one-year-old female with multiple comorbidities who developed endophthalmitis following cataract surgery  and was successfully treated after microbial identification and targeted therapy.  Case Presentation:  A one-year-old female from Kanchipuram  Tamil Nadu  presented with a bilateral white reflex since birth and was diagnosed with bilateral congenital cataract.   After preoperative evaluation  she underwent right eye cataract extraction with small incision cataract surgery (SICS)  posterior capsulorhexis (PPC)  anterior vitrectomy (AV)  and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation under general anesthesia on 22/05/24. The surgery and postoperative period were uneventful. She subsequently underwent left eye cataract surgery with the same procedure on 31/05/24  again without complications.  Two months later  she presented with left eye redness. Examination revealed an intraocular pressure of 20 mmHg  corneal edema  organizing fibrin  and hypopyon. B-scan ultrasonography demonstrated dense vitritis. A diagnosis of postoperative endophthalmitis was made.  On 19/08/24  the patient underwent right eye pars plana vitrectomy (PPV)  along with intravitreal vancomycin  ceftazidime  and vitreous biopsy. The sample was sent for culture and PCR analysis. Sequence reporting identified Brevundimonas vesicularis with 93% match.  Following sensitivity testing  the patient was treated with targeted antibiotics and responded well  with marked clinical improvement.  Discussion:  This is the first reported case of Brevundimonas vesicularis as a causative agent in postoperative endophthalmitis.

Although commonly associated with familial lipid metabolism disorders  LR may present asymptomatically and be incidentally detected during routine ophthalmic examination.  Case Presentation:  A 62-year-old female presented for a routine ophthalmic check-up. She reported no visual complaints or systemic symptoms. Her past medical history was unremarkable  with no known diagnosis of diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  or cardiovascular disease. On examination  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes. However  fundus examination revealed a striking creamy white discoloration of both retinal arteries and veins extending to the peripheral retina. The retinal background exhibited a salmon-pink hue. These findings were consistent with Grade 3 Lipemia Retinalis according to the Vinger and Sachs classification.  In the absence of other ocular pathology  the unusual vascular appearance prompted an immediate systemic evaluation. Laboratory investigations revealed severely deranged lipid parameters: total cholesterol 330 mg/dL  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 14 mg/dL  triglycerides 6310 mg/dL  very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1262 mg/dL  non-HDL cholesterol 316 mg/dL. These findings were highly suggestive of familial hypertriglyceridemia  a potentially life-threatening metabolic disorder if left undiagnosed and untreated.  Given the alarming levels of triglycerides and the risk for acute pancreatitis and cardiovascular complications  the patient was urgently referred to her primary care physician and subsequently to a lipid specialist for prompt initiation of treatment. Further systemic assessment and family screening were recommended to identify underlying genetic predisposition., Non Members, , Dr Anand Rajendran , anandr@aravind.org, 9894206777, Aravind eye hospital  chennai , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-10 07:12:06]

Baseline visual acuity  tumour dimension on B scan ultrasound  subretinal fluid (SRF) height on SSOCT and tumour location and characteristics using ultra-widefield fundus photography were noted. TTT with a diode laser of 810nm was delivered via an indirect ophthalmoscope over the tumour using a standard set protocol. Patients were followed up monthly over four months and their responses were analysed between the two groups.   Results- SRF resorption was noted in all 15 patients treated using ICG Enhanced TTT and 13 patients with TTT alone. There was a significant improvement in VA in ICG Enhanced TTT (logMar 1.02  0.55 to 0.646 0.49) as compared to the TTT alone group (logMar 0.85   0.59 to 0.66   0.55) (p-value: 0.04). A significant decrease in AT and LBD was noted in both groups. The mean average power used was significantly lower in the ICG TTT group as compared to TTT alone (419mW vs 516mW). No statistically significant difference was found in the number of laser sessions between the two groups.  Conclusion: ICG-enhanced TTT is an effective treatment modality for CCH. It results in better visual improvement than TTT alone  and significantly less power is required for treatment success., DOS Members, LD-1810, DR.

DESIGN Retrospective study METHODS A 13-year-old female presented to the glaucoma clinic of a tertiary hospital with complaints of gradual progressive painless loss of vision in left eye for the past 3 years. H/o redness of left eye was present since childhood. On examination  pink well-defined patches were seen on the forehead and temporozygomatic part of left side of face. BCVA of RE was 6/6  LE was 6/12. Scleral AV malformation was evident. On gonioscopy  both eyes showed open angles. CDR 0.3 in RE and 0.6 in LE was seen on fundoscopy. RNFL-OCT and visual field analysis of both eyes were done. Since LE IOP was uncontrolled despite use of antiglaucoma medications  trabeculectomy was performed for the patient.   RESULTS Post-trabeculectomy  LE IOP was in high teens during the 2 months follow up. LE BCVA was 6/9p.   CONCLUSION Sturge–Weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by capillary venous malformations in the skin  eye and brain with occurrence of angiomas of face  choroid  and leptomeninges. Glaucoma is the most common ocular complication in SWS. The most frequent is congenital glaucoma  but it can occur in children and adults  making careful ophthalmic follow-up necessary. Glaucoma management is challenging in SWS due to its early development and poor response to standard medications. Surgery is frequent to obtain long-term control of IOP in order to avoid visual function loss., Non Members, , Dr Nishat Sultana, nishatsultana29@gmail.com, 9845425529, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute , Non Members, , Dr Anuradha A, anudranu@gmail.com, 9986709160, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute , Non Members, , Dr Vidyadevi M, aarya14pari18@gmail.com, 9945937648, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute , Non Members, , Dr Deeja SS, ssdeeja12@gmail.com, 8848376679, Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute , 2025-04-10 16:00:43]

Eyes with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) and secondary glaucoma were excluded from the study. . Indocyanine green (ICG) dye (0.1 ml of 0.1%) was used as a tracer dye for aqueous angiography and injected into the anterior chamber using a 30 gauge needle  prior to phacoemulsification. Image acquisition was done using a commercially available fluorescence camera in infra-red mode to bring the limbus to focus. The image at 60 seconds was used for quantitative analysis. The quantitative analysis of the aqueous outflow was performed by dividing the aqueous outflow pathways in 8 equal sectors (45 degree each) concentric to the limbus using ImageJ software. Conclusion: The aqueous outflow varies between different sectors in POAG eyes. The maximum aqueous outflow signal in mild and moderate POAG eyes was observed in naso-inferior sector and in naso-superior sector in severe POAG eyes  whereas  the least aqueous flow was observed in infero-nasal sector in mild and moderate POAG eyes and in infero-temporal sector in severe POAG eyes suggesting that targeted minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) can be performed in high flow or low flow quadrants can improve its outcome., DOS Members, BD-1876, Dr. NITIKA BERI, BERINITIKA@GMAIL.COM, 9871130760, University College of Medical Sciences  delhi, DOS Members, A-3897, Dr. DEWANG ANGMO, dewang45@gmail.com, 9810896270, Dr Rajendra prasad centre for ophthalmic sciences AIIMS Delhi, DOS Members, S-317, Dr. NAMRATA SHARMA, namrata.sharma@gmail.com, 9810856988, Dr Rajendra prasad centre for ophthalmic sciences AIIMS Delhi, Non Members, , Dr. Tanuj Dada, tanujdada@gmail.com, 9873336315, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS Delhi, 2025-04-10 19:34:27]

Methods: A retrospective comparative analysis. This study recruited children with mild -moderate PCG (corneal diameter <14.5 mm  grade 1 corneal haze) from December 2021 till June 2023 who underwent surgical intervention for intra-ocular pressure (IOP) control.  The IOP reduction  frequency of complications and need for repeat EUA in each group were analysed. The patient’s data recorded at baseline and then at post-operative periods 1st  3rd  6th and 12th month were analysed. Surgical success was defined as absolute when IOP <18mmHg was achieved without medications and qualified when the same was achieved with glaucoma medications. Eyes with IOP >18mmHg on maximum medicines  those with IOP <6mmHg or need for further surgical intervention for IOP lowering were considered failures.  Results: Ninety-eight eyes from 68 children diagnosed with PCG were analysed  having undergone either CTT (58 eyes from 38 children) or GATT (40 eyes from 30 children) with a 12-month follow-up  which showed similar success rates (p=0.6  Log Rank test). The incidence of postoperative complications (34% vs 20%  p<0.001) and the need for repeat EUAs (0 vs 1.27/eye  p=0.05) were significantly higher in the CTT group than in the GATT group.  Conclusions: In mild-moderate PCG eyes  GATT demonstrated similar surgical success with a better safety profile in PCG children than CTT and can be preferred as the first-line surgical modality. , DOS Members, GD-1506, DR.

This review aims to summarize the clinical manifestations  diagnosis  and treatment of Oestrus ovis infestation in the eye. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant cases and studies. The results show that Oestrus ovis infestation can cause a range of symptoms  including conjunctivitis  chemosis  and foreign body sensation. Patients may also experience pain  redness  and swelling of the affected eye.  Method  Diagnosis is typically made by identifying the larvae on the eye or conjunctiva. Treatment involves manual removal of the larvae  and in some cases  topical betadine antibiotic therapy may be necessary to prevent secondary infection. Done studies shows tobacco topical drops for treatment of such cases but in our cases betadine drops were very effective and prevented complications too in these patients .  Conclusion  Prevention measures include avoiding exposure to flies  wearing protective eyewear  and maintaining good hygiene. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent complications and promote optimal outcomes. This review highlights the importance of considering Oestrus ovis infestation in the differential diagnosis of ocular symptoms  particularly in individuals with a history of exposure to flies or livestock. A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose and manage this condition effectively. By understanding the clinical manifestations and treatment options  healthcare professionals can provide optimal care for patients with Oestrus ovis infestation of the eye. Regular follow-up appointments are crucial to monitor for potential complications and ensure successful treatment outcomes., Non Members, , Jitender Phogat , drjitenderphogat@gmail.com, 9306355472, Rio Pgims , Non Members, , Manisha nada , manisha_nada@rediffmail.com, 9306355472, Rio Pgims , Non Members, , Kritika Jain , dr.kritikajain2016@gmail.com, 9821294968, Rio Pgims , Non Members, , Bhumish rai , bhumishofficial@gmail.com, 9821294968, Rio Pgims , 2025-04-10 20:04:13]

Initial synechiolysis was performed to release the adhesions between the iris and anterior capsule  followed by mechanical stretch pupilloplasty to further enlarge the pupil. Despite these maneuvers  optimal exposure remained limited  necessitating the placement of iris hooks for adequate pupil dilation and intraoperative stability.  Given the dense nature of the cataract  a hybrid nucleus management technique was employed. Initial 4-quadrant sculpting was used to create a central debulking trench and improve visualization of posterior plate dynamics. This was followed by multi-level chopping to effectively fragment and emulsify the dense nuclear material while maintaining chamber stability and minimizing stress on the zonules and iris.  The case highlights key surgical modifications and intraoperative strategies for managing complex cataracts in the setting of poor pupil dilation and fibrotic synechiae  with emphasis on maintaining safety  visualization  and control throughout the procedure., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-11 07:33:57]

We suspected cellulitis on first encounter and treated him with oral antibiotics along with anti-inflammatory medications. With no major improvement. Further investigations were done to rule out dysthyroid condition. When blood investigations showed normal ESR  CRP and a normal thyroid profile. We did USG Orbit which showed a well-defined  hypoechoic cystic structure in medial rectus muscle with a tiny echogenic focus within the cyst associated with surrounding edema. MRI orbit and brain along with x-ray leg was done to look for other foci of cysticercosis. MRI confirmed a peripheral enhancing cystic lesion in right medial rectus with intramuscular edema and no sign of neurocysticercosis. Patient was started on antiparasitic medications. With improvement in symptoms Conclusion- Orbital myo-cysticercosis  though rare  should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical or unresponsive cases of cellulitis  especially in endemic regions. Early use of imaging modalities like ultrasonography and MRI can aid in accurate diagnosis and prevent unnecessary treatment delays.

The choice of anesthesia technique impacts patient comfort and procedural efficacy. Subconjunctival anesthesia has emerged as an attractive alternative due to its potential to provide effective pain relief and surgeon comfort during surgery. A novel aspect of this study is the inclusion of 1:1 00 000 adrenaline in 2% lignocaine for subconjunctival anesthesia  which has not been previously studied. Subjects/Methods: A prospective  randomized  comparative study involving 196 eyes evaluated the safety and efficacy of subconjunctival anesthesia in phacoemulsification surgery. Pain scores during surgery and one hour post-surgery  surgeon discomfort  complications and additional anesthesia requirement were assessed. Statistical analysis employed descriptive statistics  t-tests  chi-squared tests  and correlations. Results: Subconjunctival anesthesia significantly lowered pain scores during surgery (p < 0.001) and one hour post-surgery (p < 0.001) compared to topical anesthesia. Surgeon discomfort was notably reduced with subconjunctival anesthesia (p < 0.001). Subconjunctival hemorrhage (p = 0.012) and redness (p = 0.024) were more prevalent postoperatively. No significant difference was observed in intraoperative complications (p = 0.573) or postoperative corneal clarity (p = 0.347). Conclusion: Subconjunctival anesthesia  with the novel inclusion of 1:1 00 000 adrenaline in 2% lignocaine  provides effective pain relief and reduces surgeon discomfort during phacoemulsification surgery. The addition of adrenaline extends anesthesia duration. Subconjunctival anesthesia holds promise for enhanced patient comfort and procedural efficiency. Further research is needed to validate its  benefits and broader application in evolving ophthalmic surgical practices. , DOS Members, R-5591, DR.

On  clinical and slit lamp examination  BCVA was HMCF  PR accurate with lid edema  purulent discharge  diffuse conjectival congestion and chemosis  corneal epithelial defect 10x10mm  central dense stromal infiltrates 6x6mm  with peripheral ring infiltrate of 3mm  diffuse stromal edema and paracentral thinning suggestive of a presumptive diagnosis of CL induced bacterial (Pseudomonas) keratitis. Experimental therapy for the corneal ulcer was started  and corneal scraping was performed. Grams stain was s/o abundant polymorphs  and the bacterial culture of scraping and contact lens solution showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive only to Piperacillin-tazobactum  Polymyxin B  and Meropenem. Clinical resolution was seen using E/D Piperacillin-Tazobactum 10%  and E/D Polymyxin B 30 000 IU. A topical steroid was added at day 4 after resolution was seen with antimicrobial treatment. Symptoms and signs reduced  and the ulcer was resolved at 6 weeks  leaving behind a central anterior and mid stromal 6x5mm scar.   Conclusion: Contact lenses should be used carefully keeping in mind all precautions to prevent infection. Since the trend of CL wear increasing in developing countries like India – we should be aware of such complications and their management. Detailed history taking and examination  culture of contact lens and solution along with scraping helps in early clinical diagnosis and effective therapy.  , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-11 14:25:44]

Methods: A prospective pilot study was conducted at the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  including 44 patients who underwent therapeutic PK. Preoperative evaluations were performed  and comprehensive ocular examinations done. Clinical diagnoses were made based on the history and examination by experienced ophthalmologists. Corneal scrapings were obtained for microbiological diagnosis through smear and culture. The excised corneal button after PK was divided into two halves  one for microbiological examination and the other for histopathological examination. Results: The study included 44 cases  with mean duration of presentation was 7.16 ± 5.3 weeks. Fungal keratitis was found in 45% (n=20/44) of cases  bacterial keratitis in 23% (n=10/44)  and non-specific disease in 32% (n=14/44). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using corneal scraping culture as the gold standard. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis for bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis were 30.77% and 75%  respectively. The specificity of clinical diagnosis for bacterial keratitis and fungal keratitis were 90.32% and 50%  respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear were 40% and 83.33%  respectively  while Gram stain showed sensitivity and specificity of 30.77% and 96.77%  respectively. Histopathology had a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 41.67%. Conclusion: Based on the study findings  clinical diagnosis alone showed limited sensitivity in predicting the probable cause of microbial keratitis. Empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis should cover both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. , DOS Members, M-4383, DR.

Method: A 54-year-old hypertensive male on dialysis presented with bilateral diminution of vision for one year. Best-corrected visual acuity was 6/18 in the right eye and counting fingers at 2 meters in the left. Slit-lamp examination revealed bilateral posterior embryotoxon and pseudophakia with posterior capsular opacification. Gonioscopy revealed angle dysgenesis in both eyes though the intraocular pressures were within normal range. Fundus examination of both eyes showed anomalous tilted oval disc with an elevated cup but the cup disc ratio could not be appreciated  moreover chorioretinal atrophic patches with peripheral retinal pigmentation were present. YAG laser capsulotomy was performed in the left eye following which bilateral peripheral iridotomy was done. No immediate postoperative complications were noted  and intraocular pressures remained stable during follow-up. Conclusion: Posterior embryotoxon  although often incidental  may be part of a broader anterior segment dysgenesis. The combination of angle anomalies  oval disc morphology  and retinal pigmentary changes suggested a possible developmental ocular syndrome. However  systemic findings did not support a specific syndromic diagnosis. In this patient  targeted laser intervention led to clinical improvement  highlighting the value of timely diagnosis and management. A multidisciplinary approach with regular follow-ups is essential in such patients with systemic comorbidities and complex ocular anatomy. , DOS Members, B-1560, DR.

METHODOLOGY: For the precise IOL calculation in such ectatic eyes  the K values by  tru nat algorithm would be considered along with the barretts universal formula . Monofocal toric intraocular lenses could be considered for implantation as the toric component will neutralize the astigmatism due to ectatic shape of the cornea and the monofocal component could be superior to multifocal IOL as it reduces aberration due to multifocality. Still  if residual astigmatism persists  that could be taken care of by limbal relaxing incision (LRI) of femtosecond laser. RESULT: Femtosecond laser-assisted clear lens extraction followed by IOL implantation could be considered a better option over the traditional treatment method of ectatic /  keratoconus corneas  as it reduces the dependency on the rigid contact lenses and high-power minus glasses. Conclusion : Post-thirties patient with relative stable status of ectatic cornea over 1 year could be considered for femtosecond laser-assisted clear lens extraction followed by intraocular lens (IOL) implantation as post-thirties ectatic progression usually stablises and reduces the need of rigid contact lenses  and over powered minus glasses . , DOS Members, P-450, MAJ GEN (DR) J.

The majority of reported cases originate from India  where environmental factors (such as poor hygiene and sanitation) and genetic predispositions may contribute to its occurrence. This case provides a compelling documentation of a unique presentation of disseminated cysticercosis  involving the brain  eye  and various muscles. A 38- year-old male presented with unilateral vision loss. Ocular examination revealed a subconjunctival cyst and a multiloculated communicating cyst in the subretinal space  herniating into the vitreous cavity  temporal to the fovea in his right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple ring-shaped hyperintense lesions with an internal eccentric scolex (cyst with dot sign) peppered throughout both cerebral hemispheres and orbits. Systemic evaluation further confirmed disseminated cysticercosis in the sternocleidomastoid and biceps muscles. Surgical removal of the intraocular and subconjunctival cysts was performed  followed by the initiation of antihelminthic therapy and steroids. The large subretinal cyst was found to communicate with an intravitreal cyst through a retinal defect  accompanied by surrounding retinal fibrosis. The fibrotic tissue caused a tight ring of constriction at the site of communication. The surgical video demonstrates how radial incisions were made to relax the fibrotic retina  preventing enlargement of the retinal defect while ensuring complete in toto removal of the cyst. The patient maintained a good anatomical and visual outcome on follow-up., Non Members, , Shorya Vardhan Azad, shoryaazad@gmail.com , , AIIMS  New Delhi, DOS Members, KD-1668, Dr. DEVESH KUMAWAT, DEVESHKUMAWAT21@GMAIL.COM, 9711797688, AIIMS  New Delhi, DOS Members, K-8177, Dr. ANANYA JAYANAND KAGINALKAR, AJKANGINALKAR@GMAIL.COM, 9552570270, AIIMS  New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-13 11:28:25]

Effective treatment requires meticulous preoperative planning  often necessitating intraoperative improvisation due to the diverse nature of foreign bodies and associated ocular injuries. This video showcases a series of challenging cases involving open globe injuries with retained IOFBs. Some cases can be straightforward  such as removing an IOFB from the vitreous cavity following pars plana vitrectomy through a scleral or limbal approach  depending on the foreign body size and associated lens injury. However  longstanding retained iron IOFBs can lead to ocular siderosis  causing dense corneal staining  cataracts  vitreous haze  and fibrous encapsulation of the foreign body. The removal of a perforating foreign body lodged partly inside the sclera posterior to the equator is a difficult surgical emergency that can result in retinal tears and choroidal bleeding despite careful maneuvering. We introduce a novel approach for the management of such a case involving posterior extraocular exploration and foreign body removal by an external approach  facilitated by maintaining low intraocular pressure following core vitrectomy. This series also emphasizes the variability in management according to foreign body size. A patient can present with perfect vision having a retained small thin copper wire  while another can have a dense vitreous hemorrhage with a 16 mm long metallic rod retained inside the globe. Both these situations warrant urgent yet cautious surgical intervention to have a good prognosis.

Methods: A 8-year-old girl  presented with decreased vision in the right eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was COUNTING FINGER 0.5 meter in the right eye and 6/6 in the left. Patient had 20 to 25 degree exotropia. Fundus examination revealed a subretinal orange lesion with Pigmentation and well defined margin in the macula of the right eye. B-scan ultrasonography showed a choroidal calcification suggestive of Osteoma. Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) showed areas of Isoautofluorescence and Hyperautofluorescence. The patient came for follow-up after 7 years in 2015. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) indicated foveal thinning and choroidal mass elevating retina. Patient was called for regular 6 monthly follow up which showed no progression of the disease. Patient wanted Squint correction surgery in 2024 and the disease was status Quo Conclusion: The lesion remained stable without progression. The patients visual acuity in the right eye remained unchanged at Counting finger 0.5 Meter  and no complications such as choroidal neovascularization developed during the follow-up period. Choroidal osteoma can occur in children  presenting as a yellow-orange subretinal lesion. Early diagnosis using multimodal imaging aids in distinguishing it from other retinal pathologies.

Methodology: We compared the variations in incidence  patterns and trends of ROP among five centres of Karnataka state with one urban  one semi-urban and three rural healthcare facilities. Total sample included 60% from rural government hospitals  21% from a rural private hospital and rest from an urban private hospital. We also compared the data of a prospective and a retrospective cohort among the same centres. Outcome measures: Most of the data available for ROP is from developed parts of country. In this study we will compare and contrast the emerging patterns and outcome of ROP in these centres. Results: Urban facilities showed preference for treatment of males than females. Average birth weight and treatment with discharge rate(7.8%) was highest in rural private hospital. Rural government hospitals have highest discharge from ROP(25.1%) and rural private hospitals have higher urgent follow ups(2.9%). Follow up rate was similar(71%-74%). Conclusion: Over 65% of Indian population is in villages and less than 100 ROP specialists as per the Indian ROP society. A vast majority of infants are left unscreened are at a potential risk for untreated ROP. Stressing importance of ROP screening services in rural India. , Non Members, , Dr Anand Vinekar, anandvinekar@yahoo.com, , Narayana Nethralaya Bangalore, Non Members, , Dr Sherine Marina D Souza Braganza, drsherine@gmail.com, , Narayana Nethralaya, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-13 13:12:44]

Prompt diagnosis and timely management are essential to achieve optimal visual outcomes.  Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the clinical profile  surgical outcomes  and visual rehabilitation in children undergoing cataract surgery at a tertiary eye care center.  Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 60 pediatric cataract cases operated between February 2024 and March 2025. Data collected included demographic details  preoperative visual acuity  cataract morphology  associated ocular anomalies  and intraoperative/postoperative complications. Surgeries performed included lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy  ECCE  phacoemulsification  and SICS  with or without IOL implantation based on age. Visual outcomes were assessed using fixation patterns and Snellen’s chart.  Results: The majority of patients were boys (63.3%). Congenital cataracts were more frequently associated with nystagmus and poorer preoperative visual acuity. Postoperative outcomes showed improvement in 82.8% of patients  with 39.5% achieving a visual acuity of ?6/18. Amblyopia was the leading cause of suboptimal vision  present in 63.3% of cases. Spectacles were the most common modality of optical correction. Complications included posterior capsular opacification  uveitis  and IOL decentration.  Conclusion: Early detection  surgical intervention  and post-operative visual rehabilitation are critical for improving visual outcomes in pediatric cataract. Congenital cataracts  particularly when operated late  are associated with a higher risk of amblyopia and poorer prognosis. Regular follow-up and parental awareness are vital for timely management and prevention of long-term visual disability. , DOS Members, G-73, Dr. ALKA GUPTA, dralkag@gmail.com, 9412201639, llrm medical college, DOS Members, S-3732, Dr. LOKESH KUMAR SINGH, drlokeshgeorgian2000@yahoo.com, 9720070704, llrm medical college, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-13 17:25:41]

But pupil size becomes further small posing a challenge for cortex removal and IOL implantation. However Bi manual Irrigation Aspiration was done using irrigator support for pupil stretching and IOL was implanted in posterior chamber under irrigation. As a routine practice posterior chamber was inspected once again by stretching pupil with Sinskey hook to look for retained lens matter and confirming the IOL placement in the bag. Surprisingly small nuclear fragment was hiding in the subincisional area and trailing haptic of the IOL was found in the sulcus. IOL was dialed into the bag and nuclear fragment was removed with phaco probe and the case was closed by hydrating the wounds.

History of jaundice 1 year back. Skin rashes since 2 months. On treatment for seizures since 4 years. Diagnosed HbsAg positive 6 months back. Vegetarian by diet. BCVA  6/6 in right eye and counting fingers at 3 meters in left eye. Anterior segment was unremarkable. LE fundus showed large subretinal cyst confimed on USG. MRI suggestive of extensive neurocysticercosis in brain  orbit  infratemporal fossa  cheek  masticator  parapharyngeal muscle  bilateral lateral rectus  right superior and inferior rectus  left superior oblique.4Gastroenterologist  neurologist opinion and physician clearance obtained. Started on topical steroids and oral prednisolone 1mg/kg/day dose with weekly tapering.  Result- At 1week  increase in subretinal fluid around the immobile subretinal cyst involving macula was seen. VR surgery ( Lensectomy + Vitrectomy +  Membrane peeling + Relaxing retinotomy + LPFC + Cyst removal + Endolaser + Silicone oil injection) left eye was done but unfortunatenately vision remained low due to involvement of macula. Tablet albendazole 400 mg  twice daily with tablet albendazole was continued.  Conclusion- This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and management of subretinal cysticercosis in a vision-threatening and challenging case. Subretinal cysticercosis occurs rarely  but the early diagnosis is very important to prevent the threatening of vision especially with co-existing neurocysticercosis. Subretinal cyst can still be removed surgically in toto without spilling the contents even in a challenging case.  , DOS Members, S-7255, DR.

Methods: A 65-year-old female presented with left eye redness  pain  and decreased vision for 1.5 months. She reported using well water for eye washing. On examination  left eye vision was hand movements with defective projection of rays. Slit-lamp evaluation revealed a central ring-shaped corneal ulcer with stromal infiltrate and hypopyon. She was a known diabetic (Type 2) with uncontrolled blood sugar levels at presentation. Corneal scrapings were sent for microbiological testing. Based on clinical signs of fungal keratitis  empirical topical and systemic antimicrobial therapy was initiated along with supportive care. A physician was consulted for diabetic management. Microbiological tests confirmed Acanthamoeba and fungal elements  with culture revealing E. coli. Treatment was modified to include 0.02% chlorhexidine eye drops and antimicrobials based on sensitivity. Due to worsening condition and unavailability of donor cornea for therapeutic keratoplasty  the patient underwent intracameral antimicrobial injections and prophylactic cyanoacrylate glue with bandage contact lens application. Conclusion: Acanthamoeba keratitis is rare  and co-infection with fungal and bacterial pathogens in an elderly diabetic poses a serious threat to vision.

Methods: Eighteen patients with smear positive fungal keratitis  not responding to conventional topical/ systemic antifungal therapy upto 2weeks were included in the study. They were given ISV (50 µg in 0.1 ml) around the ulcer and continued to receive conventional antifungal therapy. Responses to treatment (decrease in size of the ulcer and infiltrates) were recorded daily for 3-days  at 1-week and every 2 weeks for 3-months  or until the ulcer had healed completely. Results: The mean age at presentation was 51±17.83 years. The most common organism isolated was Fusarium (17/18)  followed by Aspergillus (1/18). All the patients were successfully treated in terms of corneal healing but one case did not improve in vision due to the existence of diabetic macular edema. 6 patients improved after a single injection 7 had to receive 2 and 5 improved after 3 injections. The mean number of injections in 17 treated patients was 1.94 ± 0.78. Moreover  the mean resolution time was 18.50 ± 6.25 days. The size of ulcer and height of hypopyon at presentation were noteworthy risk-factors linked to management outcomes. Deeper ulcers required a greater number of injections when compared to superficial ulcers. The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.94 to0.25 at 3 months follow-up in all the patients. Conclusion: Intrastromal Voriconazole(50 µg/ 0.1 mL) appears to be an effective adjunct therapy in cases of recalcitrant deep fungal keratitis non-responding to conventional antifungals. , Non Members, , ATUL BHIRUD, , , MILITARY HOSPITAL JALANDHAR, Non Members, , AVINASH MISHRA, , , COMMAND HOSPITAL KOLKATA, Non Members, , MOHINI AGRAWAL, mohiniafmc.15@gmail.com, , MILITARY HOSPITAL JALANDHAR, Non Members, , JYOTI SHARMA, , , , 2025-04-14 13:17:26]

Results:In our study chorioretinal atrophy  Fuchs spots were observed more frequently with higher axial lengths(>26.5mm) lacquer cracks was seen in patients with axial length >28.5mm posterior staphyloma was less common than fuchs spots and lacquer cracks in our study group. A steady rise from 75% in the range of average axial length <23.5mm to 100% in all eyes of average axial length of 23.5mm and above was seen in eyes with crescent. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of asymptomatic highly myopic subjects in this study were found to have peripheral retinal degenerative as well as posterior pole chorioretinal lesions which were also strongly associated with high axial length of globe. This can be associated with serious vision threatening complications and therefore patients should be educated about these complications and advised to seek ophthalmic care regularly. , DOS Members, G-73, Dr. ALKA GUPTA, dralkag@gmail.com, 9412201639, LLTRM Medical College, DOS Members, S-3732, Dr. LOKESH KUMAR SINGH, drlokeshgeorgian2000@yahoo.com, 9720070704, LLRM Medical College, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-14 17:42:34]

Methods:  The first case highlights the management of retinal detachment under oil. Resurgery was done under oil without removing the silicon oil. The video highlights intricate membrane dissection under oil  SRF drainage  and endo-laser. The second case reveals the successful management of a retinal detachment characterized by substantial rigidity and the presence of multiple subretinal bands. After the removal of subretinal bands  a surprising challenge emerges during the fluid-air exchange as subretinal air complicates the procedure  necessitating a skillful execution of a 360-degree relaxing retinectomy. The third case highlights the management of extensive subretinal bleeding occurring during the removal of subretinal bands. In response to this intraoperative challenge  the surgeon adeptly performs a posterior retinotomy to remove the bleed. Conclusion: Complex situations during the vitreoretinal surgical procedures need to be handled with care for best surgical results., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-14 19:37:15]

The study aimed to analyse the overall experience  benefits and challenges of simulator training for phacoemulsification surgery at two teaching eye hospitals in North India.  Methods An online semi-structured questionnaire was emailed as a Google form to all postgraduate ophthalmology residents undergoing training on the simulator (EyeSi  VRMagic). The questionnaire comprised 26 questions on various aspects such as duration of use  microsurgery skill development  assistance in individual steps of cataract surgery  effect on anxiety and confidence  perceived effect on surgical outcomes and limitations. Response on Likert scale was used to assess various parameters.   Results Forty-two residents responded to the questionnaire. Capsulorrhexis(95.2%) nucleus sculpting(85.7%)and chopping(85.7%)were the most frequently practised steps. The maximum perceived benefit was observed for capsulorrhexis(76.2%)while nucleus chopping was found to be most challenging(31%). Residents found it useful for developing hand-eye coordination(66.7%) instrument handling (52.4%)and overcoming hand tremors (47.2%). 92.9% residents responded that prior training on simulator improved their confidence before actual surgery.76.2% of postgraduates agreed that simulator training helped in reducing  surgical complications while 97.5% would recommend it to their juniors.  Conclusion This study gives an insight into the residents perspective on simulation training and indicates that most residents find it useful for phaccoemulsification surgical skill development. Simulator training thus is a promising teaching-method to improve surgical outcomes of residents and eventually benefit patients.  , DOS Members, S-5996, Dr. AASTHA SINGH, draasthasingh@gmail.com, 8002252817, , DOS Members, S-335, DR.

Methods: A middle-aged female presented with nyctalopia and dimunition of vision. Fundus examination showed patchy chorioretinal atrophy with sparing of the central macula  suggestive of CHM. Family history revealed no significant ocular disorders. Genetic analysis confirmed a pathogenic CHM gene mutation. Screening of her asymptomatic adolescent son revealed peripheral retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling on fundus examination  despite normal visual acuity and no subjective complaints. On FAF and OCT in the mother we noticed chorioretinal degeneration typical of choroideremia. Her son showed early peripheral hypoautofluorescence on wide field.  Conclusion: This case underscores that female carriers of CHM mutations can manifest symptomatic disease  likely due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation (Syed et al.  2020). Additionally  early fundus changes in asymptomatic males call for routine screening in at-risk individuals  enabling early diagnosis and potential therapeutic interventions (Edwards et al.  2019  Battu et al.  2022). Genetic counseling and regular ophthalmologic evaluation are essential for families with CHM mutations. Although definitive treatment is not available  still we can provide symptomatic and early treatment in form of low vision aids or visual rehabilitation. , DOS Members, KD-1140, DR.

The surgery was performed using  Alcon’s CENTURION® based Silver Visual System with 20 Gauge aspiration bypass system (ABP) flare tip. During quadrant removal  the nucleus demonstrated poor followability  and no vacuum buildup was observed in the system. Increasing the Phaco power demonstrated no effect. The surgeon identified an oblique break in the phaco tip  located in the distal quarter  while it remained within the sleeve. The Phaco probe was immediately retrieved from the anterior chamber and the tip was replaced. The surgery was finished uneventfully with no retained metallic foreign body.  Conclusion : Phaco tip is the working end of phacoemulsification hand piece  usually made of medical grade titanium alloy with an outer diameter of 0.9mm and inner diameter of 0.8mm. It has a hollow tube called shaft  tip and ABS port  a micro hole near the tip for continuous aspiration. The primary risk factors for Phaco tip fracture  includes the ABS design  which compromises the structural integrity of the tip. Sterlisation processes and reuse of phaco tips also contribute to metal fatigue. Another cause may be use of excessive force when dealing with hard cataracts. It is essential to be aware of this potential complication and to be equipped to manage it. , Non Members, , T Mushrifa, mushriaahmed98@gmail.com, 9933290784, Lady Hardinge Medical College  Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-14 21:37:14]

Agarwal Trophy , Glaucoma, A Comparative Study of Glaucoma Drainage Device Surgery in Children and Adults, , Background: Aqueous drainage implants have become the mainstay in the management of eyes with refractory glaucoma. The Aurolab Aqueous Drainage Implant (AADI) is a  cost-effective  non-valved drainage implant based on similar principles as the Baerveldt implant commonly used in the West. Although there are several recent reports on the efficacy and outcomes of this relatively new device  this study reports the comparative pediatric and adult outcomes  complications in a cohort with at least 2 years of follow-up.   Methods: A retrospective  comparative study including pediatric (<18 years old) and adult patients who underwent AADI surgery by the same surgeon. Success criteria included postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 18 mmHg and a 30% reduction from baseline.  Results: Hundred and nine children (109 eyes) and 150 adults (150 eyes) were included. Mean IOP and number of medications were significantly reduced postoperatively in both groups. The overall failure rate was similar in children and adults. Choroidal detachment was the most common complication in both groups in the first 3 months postoperatively. Later  tube exposure was more frequent in children  while choroidal detachment remained to be the most frequent complication in adults during 3-12 months period. Beyond one year complications were few in both groups. Children also had a higher rate of endophthalmitis and required tube repositioning more frequently than adults.  Conclusions: AADI implantation presents different postoperative challenges in children and adults  and surgeons should remain observant for complications throughout the postoperative period  especially for signs of tube exposure and endophthalmitis in pediatric patients. In our cohort adult patients were less likely to present with complications in the late postoperative phase., DOS Members, W-6930, Dr. HIRUNI KAUSHALYA WIJESINGHE, HIRZY_1@HOTMAIL.COM, 8427025433, Aravind Eye Hospital  Madurai, Non Members, , Dr. George Varghese Puthuran, georgeputhuran@gmail.com, 919443043674, Aravind Eye Hospital  Madurai, Non Members, , Dr. S.R.

Methods: An ambispective study was conducted at a tertiary-care center in North India between May 2022 to December 2024. UWFFA images (Optos Tx200) of 396 RV patients were reviewed  images of 171 eyes of 117 patients were found suitable for angiographic features. Capillary non-perfusion (CNP) was assessed in clock hours across three zones: central zone 1 (radius 6 mm)  mid-peripheral zone 2 (radius 6–15 mm)  and peripheral zone 3 (beyond 15 mm). Logistic regression identified predictors of retinal NV (at disc [NVD]  elsewhere [NVE]  or any NV). Results: Mean age was 30.3±9.6 years  93.2% were male. RV was bilateral in 59.8% cases  active in 40.4% eyes  & venular in 86% eyes. NV was present in 54.4% eyes. Univariate analysis linked NV with vasculitis activity  vessel type  disc/perivascular leakage  and CNP. On logistic regression  zone 1 CNP was independently associated with NVD (Odds ratio OR 1.68 p<0.001)  zone 2 CNP (OR 1.39 p<0.001) & disc activity (OR 0.05 p<0.001) with NVE  and zone 2 CNP (OR 1.39 p<0.001) & perivascular leak (OR 0.13 p<0.001) with any NV. Area under ROC curve was 0.80 for NVD  0.83 for NVE and 0.85 for any NV. Conclusions: In RV  central and mid-peripheral ischemia strongly predict NVD and NVE  respectively.

Agarwal Trophy , Refractive Surgery, Double Anterior  Single Posterior (DASP) Delineation Technique with Novel Release Sign for Correct Plane Dissection in Kerato-Lenticular Extraction Procedures (KLEX), , Purpose: To describe a new technique for performing lenticule dissection in kerato-lenticular extraction procedures (SMILE  SILK  CLEAR) surgery along with the use of a novel release sign to avoid lenticule misdissection. Methods/Surgical Technique: After femtosecond laser application for KLEX procedure  the anterior and posterior planes were delineated. With our technique  posterior plane delineation is performed in the central 1 mm area with anterior plane delineation being performed on both sides of the cap side cut. The stop sign is elicited at both the edges of posterior plane delineation  which we call the double stop sign. During dissection of the anterior plane  a novel release sign is noted with a sudden release of resistance when the dissection moved from one area of the anteriorly delineated plane across the undissected region to reach the second area of the already delineated anterior plane of lenticule. This provides reconfirmation that the dissection remains in the correct plane and avoids unintentional initial posterior plane dissection.  Conclusion: Double anterior  single posterior (DASP) delineation technique along with implementation of the release sign is a valuable tool for surgeons beginning their journey with KLEX procedures. It significantly reduces the risk of complications related to lenticule misdissection and shortens the surgeons learning curve. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-15 14:54:31]

Methods: In this cross-sectional study we examined 90 patients in L.N. Medical College and J.K Hospital  Kolar road  Bhopal between June to November 2017 including 60 diabetic patients (30 with retinopathy and 30 without retinopathy in fundus photography) with 30 control non-diabetic subjects matched for age and sex. The diabetic participants were sub grouped according to the level of retinopathy (EDTRS classification). CSF was examined by means of pelli robson chart in each eye  DA was assessed with photostress test and BCVA by Snellen chart. Results: When comparing visual performance of the right and left eyes of patients in each group  CSF was significantly lower in the diabetic eyes with retinopathy than in the normal eyes or the diabetic eyes without retinopathy. Comparing to control group  there was a statistically significant CSF loss in the diabetic eyes without retinopathy (P<0.05). The mean log MAR BCVA and DA abnormalities were significantly higher in the diabetic eyes with retinopathy than in the normal eyes or the diabetic eyes without retinopathy (P<0.001). There was no significant difference observed in mean log MAR BCVA and DA between those of diabetic eye with out retinopathy compared to the control group. Conclusion: There was significant difference observed in visual performance of those diabetics with retinopathy compared to those without.

With our technique  posterior plane delineation is performed in the central 1 mm area  with anterior plane delineation being performed on both sides of the cap side cut. The stop sign is elicited at both the edges of posterior plane delineation  which we call the double stop sign. During dissection of the anterior plane  we demonstrate a novel release sign where we can see a sudden release of resistance when the dissection moves from one area of the anteriorly delineated plane across the undissected region to reach the second area of the already delineated anterior plane of lenticule providing reconfirmation of correct dissection. Our double anterior  single posterior (DASP) delineation technique significantly reduces the risk of complications related to lenticule misdissection and shortens the surgeons learning curve., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-15 16:06:51]

Methods: An ambispective study was conducted at tertiary-care center in North India over 24 months (January 2023–December 2024). Patients with VRI managed surgically by a single surgeon were included. Baseline variables included demographics  injury type/location/grade  site/extent of VRI  visual acuity (VA) and surgical intervention. Primary outcomes were retinal attachment  repeat interventions  and final VA. Statistical analysis identified the prognostic factors. Results: Thirty-four eyes were included (34 patients  age 30.8±14.0years  males 88.2%). Injury type was rupture (n=8)  penetration (n=17)  intra-ocular foreign body (n=2) or perforation (n=7) with most being grade IV injuries. Indication for intervention was vitreous hemorrhage with VRI alone (n=3) or with retinal detachment (n=31). Intervention included 25G vitrectomy alone (n=19)  with encircling band (n=24) or scleral buckling (n=1)  performed at median of 30 days (7-180 days) post-trauma. Relaxing retinotomy was performed in 22 eyes. Silicone oil was used in 31 eyes. Over median follow-up of 11.5 months  retina remained attached in 32 eyes. Re-intervention was required in 5 eyes for re-detachment  13 eyes for oil removal and 1 eye for oil exchange. Final logMAR VA was 1.36±0.54 (0.48-3)  VA?20/200 and >20/400 in 32.4% and 61.8% eyes  respectively. Only time from trauma to surgery significantly influenced outcomes. Conclusions: Despite significant injury  an early and aggressive intervention in VRI after OGI leads to high anatomical success and modest visual recovery.

Case Report: A 43 year old female presented with complains of gradually diminishing vision in both eyes. She had no significant systemic or ocular history . She was a hyperope with best corrected visual acuity of 6/6 in both eyes. Examination- Anterior Segment evaluation was unremarkable in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed bilateral inferotemporal reticular patterns consistent with degenerative retinoschisis. The diagnosis was further supported by B-Scan ultrasonography  which confirmed the presence of bilateral schitic changes in inferotemporal quadrants. Conclusion: Degenerative Retinoschisis   although commonly asymptomatic   can present with reduced visual acuity when involving macular or peri macular regions. This case highlights the importance of thorough retinal evaluation and multimodal imaging in diagnosis and management of retinoschisis. The case also emphasizes the importance of differentiating degenerative retinoschisis from other peripheral retinal pathologies due to its benign nature and typically non progressive course  although vigilance is necessary to monitor rare complications such as retinal detachment., DOS Members, GD-1974, Dr. RAGHAV GULATI, RAGHAVGULATI@HOTMAIL.COM, 9818807879, ESIC Medical College and Hospital Faridabad, Non Members, , Dr. Bhawesh Kumar, kumar123bhawesh@gmail.com, 9661505293, ESIC Medical College And Hospital Faridabad, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-15 18:54:47]

Methods Retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for large or massive idiopathic MH at a tertiary eye centre of north India between 2009 and 2020. Preoperative and postoperative data was reviewed  including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans  surgical techniques  functional and anatomical outcomes.  Results A total of 80 eyes with idiopathic MH were analyzed  with 43 in the large MH group (group A) and 37 in the massive MH group (group B). Preoperative BCVA averaged 0.94 log MAR units in group A and 1.04 log MAR units in group B. Post-operative BCVA averaged 0.514 log MAR units in group A and 0.762 log MAR units in group B. While there was no statistically significant change in BCVA within each group post-surgery (P<0.234)  the post-operative BCVA differed significantly between the two groups (P<0.05). Type 1 closure of the macular hole was achieved in 34 eyes in group A and 21 eyes in group B. Notably  anatomical outcomes favored group A.   Conclusion This study highlights superior visual and anatomical outcomes in large MH compared to massive MH following surgical intervention. Moreover  our findings suggest that while large MHs (500-1000 microns) tend to have better outcomes  surgical intervention benefits patients across both MH sizes. The efficacy of the inverted internal limiting flap (ILM) technique over routine MH surgery was observed. Conversely  routine MH surgery also demonstrated efficacy  indicating improved visual and anatomical outcomes regardless of MH size.  Overall  our study concludes the effectiveness of surgical repair for large and massive MHs in improving visual and anatomical outcomes., DOS Members, A-1045, DR.

This study investigates the association between ocular hypertension (OHT) and Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) in young adults who regularly use visual display terminals (VDTs). Conducted at the Ophthalmology OPD of Santosh Hospital  Ghaziabad  this hospital-based clinical observational study included 340 participants aged 20–40 years  all with a history of screen exposure exceeding four hours daily for over a year. Patients with glaucoma  prior ocular surgeries  or other ocular conditions were excluded.  Each participant underwent detailed ocular examinations  including tonometry using Goldmann’s applanation tonometer and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The results revealed a significant increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in individuals with CVS: 76% in the left eye and 75% in the right. Notably  47% of subjects exhibited elevated IOP  with a higher prevalence in males. The most affected group had 6–10 years of screen exposure  where the IOP elevation was most pronounced  particularly in the left eye.  The findings suggest a direct correlation between prolonged screen exposure and increased IOP  posing a potential risk for OHT in young individuals. With the left eye consistently showing higher IOP values  the study highlights asymmetrical ocular effects of digital screen use. The implications are significant for early detection and prevention of glaucomatous damage. Awareness and preventive measures  including regular eye check-ups and screen-time management  are recommended to mitigate the risk of OHT in digital device users., Non Members, , Sarita aggarwal, sarita.aggarwal@santosh.ac.in, +91 98109 72539, Santosh medical college and hospital Ghaziabad , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-15 20:19:55]

Herein  we describe an unusual case of pituitary metastasis presenting as Foster-Kennedy syndrome and severe visual loss  with relevant literature review. Methods: A 54-year-old lady presented with bilateral severe visual loss. She had been treated for metastatic thyroid cancer in the past and was in remission. At presentation  her fundus findings revealed a variant of Foster-Kennedy syndrome (FKS) and right eye sixth cranial nerve paresis. Based on the temporal visual field defect on confrontation visual fields  we insisted on a repeat neuroimaging. The MRI imaging revealed compressive lesions in sellar and occipital areas. Histopathology confirmed thyroid cancer metastasis to the pituitary gland region  which was managed by radiotherapy. Partial but useful vision could be restored in only the right eye. Conclusion: We concluded that chiasmal compression  due to pituitary metastasis  can be an uncommon cause of visual loss in a known case of cancer. Papilledema along with partial optic atrophy (FKS) was a unique association in our case of sellar metastasis. Neuro-ophthalmological examination can provide valuable insights in these cases. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-15 20:49:25]

METHODS: Observational  cross-sectional  comparative  and prospective study that included 35 patients from each category  40-60 years of age  BCVA of 6/12  good 6x6 mm OCTA scan at the macula  temporal macula  and peripapillary area using the ZEISS CIRRUS 6000 and recorded superficial vascular plexus vessel density (VD) and perfusion (VP). RESULT:  Macular VD (16.58 ± 2.7) and VP (41.66 ± 7.11) showed a significant stepwise decline across four groups  with inferior macular sectors being more affected than the superior. A significant difference in VD was found between normal and suspect eyes (p = 0.011)  suggesting early vascular changes. Peripapillary VD and VP also progressively reduced from normal to early glaucoma. The VD and VP were significantly lower in early glaucoma compared to others  indicating the diagnostic importance of assessing the peripapillary area. Additionally  temporal VD progressively decreased from normal to ocular hypertension  suspect  and early glaucoma eyes  with macular VD consistently higher than temporal  particularly in suspects and OHTN  suggesting early temporal involvement. CONCLUSION: Measuring vascular parameters differentiates between normal  disc suspects  ocular hypertensive  and early glaucoma. Temporal VD loss appeared early and progressed with disease severity  supporting its utility as a complementary OCTA parameter in early detection.  Overall  OCTA can play a complementary role in structural OCT imaging and visual field testing  aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. , DOS Members, S-326, Dr. RAMANJIT SIHOTA, rjsihota@gmail.com, 9899806749, SHROFF EYE CENTRE, DOS Members, S-3436, Dr. SWARNALI SEN, swarnalisen@yahoo.co.in, 9871438380, SHROFF EYE CENTRE, DOS Members, K-6097, Dr. SANDEEP KUMAR, guptasandeep.901@gmail.com, 9811811573, SHROFF EYE CENTRE, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-16 11:16:01]

This procedure involves transplanting conjunctival and limbal tissue  including goblet cells  from an HLA-matched living relative. It is particularly beneficial for patients with bilateral LSCD or those with unilateral LSCD in whom the fellow eye is unsuitable as a donor due to previous contact lens wear  ocular surgery  or other compromising conditions. Lr-CLAL is also indicated in cases where LSCD is accompanied by conjunctival disease or deficiency.  Lr-CLAL may be used alone or in combination with other grafting procedures  such as the Cincinnati Procedure (combining KLAL and lr-CLAL) or lr-CLAL with conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU)  depending on the severity and etiology of the disease. Postoperatively  epithelization of the ocular surface usually occurs within 1 to 5 weeks  most commonly between 2 to 3 weeks.  Outcomes vary by underlying pathology. In cohorts predominantly comprising chemical injuries or mixed etiologies  ocular surface stability was achieved in 45% to 92% of eyes. However  cases with a high proportion of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) demonstrated lower success rates (13% to 60%). Visual acuity improved by two or more lines in 40% to 100% of patients  indicating the potential for significant visual rehabilitation following lr-CLAL., DOS Members, B-943, DR.

Clinically significant macular edema (CSME)  characterized by retinal thickening or hard exudates near the macula  is a primary contributor to vision loss in diabetic patients. This observational study aimed to evaluate the influence of serum lipids on the development and severity of CSME in type 2 diabetic retinopathy cases. Conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology  Santosh Medical College and Hospital  Ghaziabad  the study included 150 patients aged 30–70 years with type 2 diabetes and CSME. Patients underwent comprehensive ocular examinations  including optical coherence tomography (OCT)  and relevant blood investigations to assess lipid profiles.  The study found a significant correlation between dyslipidemia and the severity of CSME. Specifically  elevated levels of LDL (67%)  triglycerides (50%)  cholesterol (45%)  and VLDL (34%) were commonly observed among CSME patients. A notable proportion of individuals with dyslipidemia experienced moderate (40%) to severe (27.33%) visual impairment. LDL was most strongly associated with the presence of CSME (p<0.05). The findings underscore that serum lipid abnormalities  especially elevated LDL levels  are major risk factors for both the development and progression of CSME in type 2 diabetic individuals. These results highlight the importance of early detection and effective lipid management in preserving visual function and preventing retinal complications in diabetic patients., DOS Members, B-943, DR.

The Triphobic HD lens utilizes a refractive-diffractive design to achieve trifocal functionality. Method – Three patients with bilateral cataracts underwent implantation with Trifocal HD lenses using femtosecond laser-assisted surgery  with a 7-day interval between the two eyes. The patient selection criteria included individuals with cataracts and otherwise healthy ocular structures  specifically a normal cornea and retina  without any concomitant ocular pathology that could potentially compromise visual outcomes. Visual assessments were conducted at 1 day  7 days and 1 month post-operatively  evaluating unaided near  intermediate and distance visual acuity  best-corrected visual acuity  residual refractive error  contrast sensitivity  defocus curve and dysphotopsias. Results showed significant improvement in visual acuity  with unaided logMAR 0.0 at near  intermediate  and distance. The defocus curve demonstrated a peak at 6/6 with lenses of 0 D  -1.5 D  and -3 D  indicating an inbuilt accommodative response.  Conclusion – Although patients reported mild dysphotopsias (ring shadows) when looking at light sources  they adapted quickly and achieved spectacle-free vision after bilateral trifocal lens implantation. For suitable candidates willing to undergo neuro-adaptation  these lenses offer a cost-effective solution with a wide range of vision. Triphobic HD lenses are suitable for patients with limited night-time driving needs. However  they may not be ideal for individuals with demanding personalities or those who have difficulty adapting to minor visual disturbances. , DOS Members, P-450, Dr. J.K.S.

While diabetic retinopathy (DR) is widely studied  early corneal alterations in diabetes remain less explored.  Objective - To assess central corneal thickness (CT)  corneal epithelial thickness (CET)  and corneal stromal thickness (CST) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients without diabetic retinopathy using anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT).  Methods- This prospective  cross sectional study included 40 eyes from 20 newly diagnosed T2DM patients (HbA1c ? 7%) and 40 eyes from age and gender matched healthy controls. All participants underwent basic ophthalmic examinations  including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  intraocular pressure (IOP)  and slit-lamp evaluation. AS-OCT was used to measure CT  CET  and CST at the central cornea (6-mm diameter). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (v21.0).  Results: No significant differences were observed in age  gender  BCVA  or IOP between groups. However  diabetic patients showed significant increases in:  Central CT (552.4 ± 21.8 µm vs. 534.6 ± 19.2 µm  p < 0.001)   Central CET (53.8 ± 3.2 µm vs. 49.9 ± 2.7 µm  p < 0.001)   Central CST (498.6 ± 20.5 µm vs. 484.7 ± 16.9 µm  p < 0.001).  Conclusion: AS-OCT detects significant corneal thickening in newly diagnosed T2DM patients even before DR onset  suggesting its role as a non-invasive marker for early diabetic changes., DOS Members, S-819, Dr. ASHOK SHARMA, ashoksharma@yahoo.co.in, 9419188009, Government Medical College  Jammu, Non Members, , Dr. Nancy Sharma, nancee.shandilya@gmail.com, 9797574295, Government Medical College  Jammu, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-16 19:13:57]

The study assesses postoperative intraocular lens (IOL) tilt  decentration  and iris to IOL distance and their impact on visual and refractive outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study included 36 patients undergoing 27G MIVS-assisted SFIOL implantation. Preoperative data  including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  intraocular pressure (IOP)  endothelial cell count  and surgical indications were recorded. Postoperatively  BCVA  IOP and endothelial cell count was assessed at 3 months. Additionally  AS-OCT was used to assess IOL tilt  decentration  and distance of the IOL from posterior iris surface. Surgical complications were documented. Results: The mean IOL tilt was 3.58 ± 0.57 degrees  IOL decentration was 0.22 ± 0.47 mm  and IOL to posterior iris distance was 0.76 ± 0.66 mm. At three months  BCVA significantly improved from 0.85 ± 0.53 log MAR to 0.38 ± 0.38 log MAR (p = 0.03). Hyperopic shift (MRSE: +1.14 ± 0.62 D) correlated strongly with increased distance of IOL from posterior iris surface. Complications included early postoperative IOL tilt (n=4  requiring refixation)  vitreous hemorrhage (n=3  resolving spontaneously)  and choroidal detachment (n=2  resolving with corticosteroids). Conclusions: The 27G MIVS-assisted SFIOL technique demonstrates favorable outcomes with minimal IOL tilt and decentration. The technique offers a safe and effective alternative for scleral fixation  optimizing surgical efficiency and patient outcomes. , DOS Members, TD-2223, Dr. MANASI TRIPATHI, MANASUTRIPATHI1994@GMAIL.COM, 8859726986, I-Clinix eye hospital, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-16 19:22:02]

Notably  the patient presented 15 days after the initial trauma  and despite the delayed presentation  the conjunctiva had covered the scleral tear  encapsulating the uveal tissue within the wound gap. The patient underwent surgical repair  and the outcome was successful in restoring ocular integrity and preserving vision.  This case highlights the rare phenomenon of spontaneous conjunctival coverage over a scleral tear  which can complicate the diagnosis and management of such injuries. The delayed repair posed challenges  but ultimately  surgical intervention yielded a favorable outcome. This report discusses the clinical findings  surgical approach  and postoperative care  emphasizing the importance of prompt evaluation and treatment in similar cases to prevent long-term complications.  The case underscores the need for awareness among clinicians about the potential for delayed presentation and the complexities involved in managing such injuries.

On examination  the child exhibited a disenclaved iris claw IOL at one site  which was abnormally positioned and in contact with the corneal endothelium  resulting in localized corneal edema. Additional findings included post-traumatic mydriasis (7 mm)  significant iris atrophy  and multiple sphincter tears. Given the instability of the IOL and associated complications  the patient was scheduled for IOL explantation under general anesthesia. Intraoperatively  the IOL was surprisingly not visible within the visual axis. Detailed inspection revealed the IOL to be vertically suspended in the vitreous cavity  attached only at a single point on the iris. It was visualized by rotating the globe to its extreme positions. Surgical steps included creating two side-port incisions and placement of an anterior chamber maintainer. A 6 mm sclerocorneal tunnel with full-thickness corneal incision was fashioned. Using two Sinskey hooks  the IOL was carefully maneuvered into the anterior chamber. Enclavation on the posterior iris surface was released using intravitreal scissors  and the IOL was successfully explanted. The surgical wound was closed  and the child was scheduled for a second-stage scleral-fixated IOL (SFIOL). This case highlights a complication of iris claw IOL in a case of traumatic mydriasis and iris atrophy. Hence a careful case selection is imperative in avoiding such complications. Meticulous and timely explant of IOL in such cases can avoid long term complications like corneal decompensation and retinal detachment. , DOS Members, SD-1667, Dr. PRANITA SAHAY, drpranitasahay@gmail.com, 9871429421, Dr R P Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS  New Delhi, DOS Members, PD-2109, Dr. Ananya P.

Hormonal changes  fluid retention  and altered pharmacokinetics significantly impact intraocular pressure (IOP) and corneal physiology during gestation. We present the case of a 35-year-old primigravida in her first trimester  who reported bilateral painless diminution of vision for two weeks. A positive family history of glaucoma was noted. Ocular examination revealed advanced glaucomatous cupping and pigmentary changes on the cornea. Gonioscopy findings suggest open angles with 4+ PTM pigmentation. The diagnosis of bilateral glaucoma in pregnancy was established  though pigmentary glaucoma remained a differential due to the corneal and gonioscopic findings. Medical treatment was guided by trimester-specific safety profiles of anti-glaucoma medications. The patients non-compliance with initial medical therapy necessitated escalation to laser trabeculoplasty in the second trimester  followed by the addition antiglaucoma medications. This case highlights the need for individualized care  close coordination with obstetricians  and informed patient counselling. It raises a diagnostic dilemma—was it pigmentary glaucoma or pregnancy-exacerbated glaucoma—given the presence of Krukenberg spindles  which literature reports as a possible physiological change in pregnancy.. , DOS Members, M-323, Dr. MONICA MENOCHA NEE GANDHI, monicagandhi@yahoo.com, 8800264102, Dr Shroff Charity eye hospital Daryaganj, DOS Members, D-512, Dr. SUNEETA DUBEY, dubeysuneeta@hotmail.com, 9818224290, Dr Shroff Charity eye hospital Daryaganj, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-16 21:28:39]

Method: A 29-year-old male presented to out-patient department with acute painful diminution of vision and redness in left eye for three days associated with headache and decreased hearing in both ears. Patient also gave history of having right eye deformity with no vision since birth. On examination  right eye had severe microphthalmos. Left eye presented with best corrected visual acuity of finger counting at 1 meter and intraocular pressure of 9 mmHG. Examination revealed diffuse conjunctival and circumcorneal congestion  reaction in anterior chamber  sluggishly reacting pupil and clear lens. Fundus examination showed grade 2 vitreous haze  hyperaemic disc  dilated vessels  macular edema and serous RD. Ultrasonography confirmed exudative RD with increased choroidal thickness. Results: A differential diagnosis of pan-uveitis with exudative RD (likely tuberculosis or Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada/ VKH syndrome) was made. Pulmonologist opinion was taken but tuberculosis could not be ruled out as HRCT chest findings were suggestive of tuberculosis with multiple nodular opacities. Hence  high dose steroids were withheld  and patient was started on anti-tubercular therapy with low dose oral steroids. However  inflammation  and differential diagnosis of VKH was revisited. Patient was started on intravenous methylprednisolone and continued with slow-taper steroids and azathioprine. Patient responded well to change in therapy with controlled inflammation  settling of RD and development of posterior subcapsular cataract. Visual acuity with said treatment improved to 6/60 after 2 months of therapy. On follow up of 1 year  development of cnvm noticed and improved after Anti-VEGF. Conclusion: The diagnostic dilemma due to presence of hypersensitive pneumonitis along with probable VKH  resulted in delay of starting systemic steroid and immunosuppressant treatment.

There was history of fever with RE lid swelling followed by ptosis and decrease in extraocular movements. Birth history was uneventful. On examination  the child was not following light  the pupillary reaction in RE was sluggish  however  the fundus examination was WNL. Urgent MRI scan of the orbit and head was ordered which showed a right temporal lobe mass abutting the right orbital apex. Buphthalmos in the RE was also seen. The patient was urgently referred to neurosurgery department and was started on antiglaucoma drugs. The patient got operated and had significant improvement of extraocular movements  with decrease in cornea size and improvement in ptosis. Though the recovery was good  the patient now developed neurotrophic keratopathy in this eye.   Conclusion- Infants presenting with orbital apex syndrome are a rarity and any sign suggestive of the same should be thoroughly investigated to rule out deleterious causes like space occupying lesion in the brain.

This video presentation reflects my personal experience and hard-earned lesson from a case that began with a superficial scleral flap and spiraled into an unanticipated cascade of complications from wound hydration to almost a nuclear drop. What was planned as a combined cataract and glaucoma surgery ultimately resulted in the abandonment of the Trabeculectomy. The trouble began with what seemed like a minor deviation in flap depth—barely a millimetre off. However  this small misstep created a challenging surgical environment that jeopardized the outcome of the entire surgery.  This video does not aim to showcase a perfect case  but rather to highlight how meticulous planning and an unwavering commitment to surgical cleanliness and precision are vital—especially for beginners. It underscores the importance of respecting each step  however routine it may seem  and knowing when to stop for the patients safety. Ultimately  this experience became a powerful teacher.

Methods : In this approach  membrane dissection is performed under silicone oil  which serves as an effective tamponade and acts as a "third hand" to stabilize the retina during delicate manoeuvres. The two-port technique minimizes surgical trauma by surpassing the process of silicone oil exchange and significantly reduces the time of surgery.However  a key challenge  is the maintenance of intraocular pressure (IOP) during the final stages of surgery  particularly when subretinal fluid is drained and silicone oil needs to be replenished. The video effectively demonstrates removal of the PVR membranes  subretinal fluid drainage under oil as well as maintaining IOP with adequate silicone oil tamponade at the end of surgery.  Conclusion: This technique offers a safe and effective approach for managing complex cases of retinal redetachment in oil-filled eyes. , DOS Members, V-684, DR.

Clinical examination revealed a well-circumscribed  fleshy lesion on the palpebral conjunctiva  prompting further diagnostic evaluation. Differential diagnoses included benign lesions such as papilloma or pyogenic granuloma  as well as malignant conditions like squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. Preoperative imaging and incisional biopsy were performed to assess the extent and nature of the tumour  confirming a benign yet locally aggressive lesion necessitating complete excision.  Under local anesthesia  a meticulous surgical resection was performed with wide margins to ensure complete removal while preserving eyelid function. The defect was reconstructed using a conjunctival autograft to prevent postoperative complications such as symblepharon or eyelid malposition. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a benign conjunctival tumour with clear margins. The patient recovered well with no recurrence at six-month follow-up  demonstrating restored eyelid integrity and improved visual comfort.  This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis  appropriate preoperative assessment  and precise surgical management in treating palpebral conjunctival tumours in elderly patients. Successful outcomes depend on thorough excision  careful reconstruction  and regular postoperative monitoring to detect potential recurrence. The report underscores the need for individualized treatment approaches in ophthalmic oncology to optimize functional and aesthetic results.

A prospective  randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 patients divided into two groups: the Ripasudil group (n=150) received 0.4% Ripasudil eye drops twice daily postoperatively for one month alongside standard medications  while the control group (n=150) received standard care alone. Primary outcomes included changes in central corneal thickness (CCT)  ECD  intraocular pressure (IOP)  and visual acuity  assessed preoperatively and at intervals up to six months post-surgery.  Results demonstrated that Ripasudil significantly accelerated early visual recovery  with a 44.5% improvement in visual acuity by Day 7 compared to 35.6% in controls (p<0.001). The Ripasudil group also exhibited a lower rate of endothelial cell loss  particularly at six months (3.83% reduction vs. 8.10% in controls  p<0.001)  and a more sustained reduction in IOP (p=0.04). Corneal edema  measured by CCT  resolved faster in the Ripasudil group during the first two weeks (p<0.05). However  long-term visual outcomes were comparable between groups. Adverse effects  including ocular hyperemia (9.3%) and reticular edema (4%)  were more frequent with Ripasudil but were generally mild.  The study concludes that Ripasudil enhances early postoperative recovery and endothelial cell preservation but does not confer long-term visual benefits. Its use may be particularly advantageous for high-risk patients  though side effects warrant consideration. These findings support Ripasudil’s role as an adjunct therapy in cataract surgery  warranting further research into optimal dosing and patient selection.

Based on clinical findings and imaging results  a diagnosis of Foster Kennedy Syndrome was made  and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was planned as the initial therapeutic intervention.  CONCLUSIONS - Foster Kennedy Syndrome  though rare in the pediatric population  should be considered in patients presenting with asymmetric optic disc findings and visual loss. Early diagnosis through thorough clinical evaluation and neuroimaging is essential for identifying the underlying cause  typically an intracranial mass. Prompt neurosurgical intervention  as in this case  can help manage intracranial pressure and prevent further neurological deterioration.

Method:A 64-year-old female presented with a 12-year history of progressive diminution of vision in her left eye. There was no significant ocular or systemic history. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was reduced in the left eye  while the right eye was within normal limits. Anterior segment examination of the left eye revealed nuclear sclerosis grade 2–3 with cortical cataract changes. Fundus examination of the left eye showed a distinct optic disc pit located temporally on the optic nerve head  associated with macular edema and intraretinal fluid accumulation. The right eye fundus was normal. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) of the left eye demonstrated schitic separation of the inner retinal layers at the macula  consistent with retinoschisis  along with serous macular detachment. Fundus photography confirmed the optic disc pit in the left eye. The findings were diagnostic of optic disc pit maculopathy with retinoschisis  Conclusion:Optic disc pit is a rare congenital anomaly that can remain asymptomatic or lead to progressive visual loss due to macular changes such as retinoschisis and serous retinal detachment. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive ocular examination and the use of multimodal imaging  particularly OCT and fundus photography  in diagnosing and evaluating optic disc pit maculopathy.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is an indolent malignancy that rarely manifests with orbital signs in the absence of thyroid dysfunction or structural abnormalities. This case highlights an unusual presentation of PTC  where isolated eyelid retraction was the only clinical clue.  Case Presentation A 40 year old male presented to the ophthalmology OPD of government medical college Jammu with unilateral upper eyelid retraction. Thyroid function tests (T3  T4  TSH) were within normal limits  and initial evaluation by endocrinology ruled out Graves’ disease. Orbital ultrasound and radiological imaging revealed no masses or extraocular muscle enlargement. ENT assessment found no palpable thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy. Empirical treatment with topical steroids was initiated under the presumption of atypical TED  but the retraction persisted at one-month follow-up. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was subsequently performed  revealing papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy  with postoperative histopathology confirming the diagnosis. Notably  the eyelid retraction improved following tumor excision  suggesting a paraneoplastic or localized inflammatory mechanism.  Conclusion Isolated eyelid retraction  particularly when unresponsive to conventional therapy  should raise suspicion for underlying malignancy. A multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmology  endocrinology  and otolaryngology is essential to avoid diagnostic delays in such atypical presentations., DOS Members, S-819, Dr. ASHOK SHARMA, ashoksharma@yahoo.co.in, 9419188009, Government Medical College  Jammu , Non Members, , Dr. Nancy Sharma , nancee.shandilya@gmail.com, 9797574295, Government Medical College  Jammu , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-17 13:05:49]

He had a history of uneventful cataract surgery in the same eye three years ago. Examination revealed mucopurulent discharge  conjunctival and circumciliary congestion  a crescent-shaped superonasal epithelial defect  and diffuse corneal stromal edema. Fundus details were obscured due to corneal edema  and B-scan ultrasonography was normal. Microbiological evaluation was negative  and systemic investigations were within normal limits. A provisional diagnosis of infectious keratitis with peripheral ulcerative keratitis of unknown etiology was made  and the patient was started on empirical antibiotics  lubricants  cycloplegics  and oral steroids.  With no clinical improvement after one week  repeat examination with double lid eversion revealed a thread-like structure embedded in the superior forniceal conjunctiva. Surgical exploration confirmed a retained cotton suture around the superior rectus muscle  likely from previous cataract surgery. The foreign body was removed  adjacent inflamed conjunctiva recessed  and cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive with a bandage contact lens was applied. Culture of the suture grew *Staphylococcus* species.

A Clinical Case Study., , Purpose: Pituitary adenomas are slow-growing tumors of the anterior pituitary  with macroadenomas (>10 mm) often extending suprasellarly and compressing the optic chiasma. This case highlights the critical role of ocular symptoms in the early diagnosis and timely management of pituitary macroadenoma to prevent irreversible visual impairment.  Methods: We report a case of a 47-year-old female presenting with progressive  painless bilateral vision loss  diplopia  and associated symptoms of headache  nausea  and vomiting. Comprehensive ophthalmic examination revealed best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/60 in the right eye and 6/24 in the left. Fundus examination showed bilateral papilledema  and visual field testing confirmed bitemporal hemianopia. MRI brain revealed a complex solid-cystic sellar and suprasellar mass with cavernous sinus invasion and optic chiasma compression  suggestive of pituitary macroadenoma with apoplexy. The patient underwent endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.  Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing visual disturbances such as bitemporal hemianopia  papilledema  and ocular motility restriction as early indicators of a compressive suprasellar lesion. Prompt ophthalmological assessment  coupled with neuroimaging  can lead to early diagnosis of pituitary macroadenomas and prevent permanent visual dysfunction.

A Case Study., , Purpose: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide  typically presenting as a slow-growing  non-pigmented lesion in sun-exposed areas. A rare clinical and histological variant—pigmented BCC—exhibits increased melanin pigmentation and can mimic other pigmented dermatoses. This presentation highlights a unique case of pigmented BCC  or “black-tinted rodent ulcer ” emphasizing diagnostic challenges and management strategies.  Methods: We report a case of a 68-year-old female presenting with a solitary  asymptomatic  blackish plaque near the inner canthus of the left eye. The lesion  measuring 5x3x2 cm  had gradually increased over three years. It exhibited irregular  raised borders with pigmented papular islands and focal ulceration. Differential diagnoses included melanoma  squamous cell carcinoma  and discoid lupus erythematosus. Excision biopsy confirmed pigmented BCC with characteristic basaloid cells  pigmentation  and retraction clefting. The patient underwent complete surgical excision with narrow margins and primary closure  achieving satisfactory cosmetic and therapeutic outcomes.  Conclusion: Pigmented BCC  although rare  poses significant diagnostic dilemmas due to its resemblance to other pigmented skin lesions. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for pigmented variants of BCC  particularly in atypical presentations. Early biopsy and histopathological confirmation are essential for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Education about UV exposure and regular skin examinations remains vital in reducing BCC incidence and ensuring timely intervention. With early diagnosis and appropriate management  outcomes in pigmented BCC can be excellent., DOS Members, M-4766, Dr. RISHI MEHTA, dr_rishimehta@yahoo.com, 7742388682, Geetanjali medical college and hospital., DOS Members, C-8486, Dr. RENU CHOUDHARY, RENU.7838@GMAIL.COM, 9910506493, Geetanjali medical medical college and hospital., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-17 14:51:31]

While previously underdiagnosed  its recognition has increased due to improved diagnostic modalities. Seasonal and environmental factors may influence the incidence  but limited data is available from North India  especially Eastern Uttar Pradesh.  Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary eye care center in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Medical records of patients diagnosed with microsporidial keratitis between September 2023 and September 2024 were reviewed. Diagnosis was confirmed through smear and staining techniques including KOH  calcofluor white  and Gram staining. The monthly and seasonal distribution of cases was analyzed and correlated with regional climatic data—specifically temperature  humidity  and rainfall. Results: A total of 283 cases were identified  with the majority (76.4%) occurring during the monsoon and post-monsoon months (June to October). A statistically significant correlation was observed between elevated humidity levels and increased incidence of infection (p < 0.05). Most patients were male  engaged in agricultural or outdoor occupations  and presented with coarse  punctate epithelial keratitis.

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a macular retinal serous detachment associated with one or more leak points in the pigment epithelium. We present a case of spontaneous resolution of CSC in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy in a primiparous woman. Methods:  The case was a 19-year-old female in the 24th week of gestation presenting with sudden diminution of vision in RE since 10 days . Ophthalmological examination revealed a Visual acuity of 1/60 in Both eyes. There was no other systemic co-morbidity associated with the patient. The general examination was normal with normal blood pressure. The anterior segment examination in RE was normal and in LE microcornea   iris coloboma was observed.  During fundus examination RE had a fluid reflex around the macula and LE had a RC coloboma involving disc and macula . Optical coherence tomography showed a large serous retinal detachment confirming the diagnosis. Conclusion: CSC resolved post pregnancy necessitating the need for close follow up and observation. Due to the contraindications associated to pregnancy  the therapeutic method chosen was observation and regular follow up.  Although not typical  Pregnancy is a known risk factor for central serous chorioretinopathy. The spontaneous resorption of central serous chorioretinopathy during pregnancy is reported in the literature  hence a therapeutic abstention with ophthalmological monitoring is done.

Method: A 44-year-old female presented to our tertiary eye care hospital with phakic AC-IOL implantation in both eyes in 1995 for high myopia and now she presented with bullous keratopathy in her left eye. The phakic AC-IOL was well placed  and the crystalline lens was also healthy. The patient was taken up for left eye DSAEK under peribulbar anaesthesia. Conclusion: Phakic IOL implantation is an effective approach for correcting high refractive error  but it is not free from complications particularly phakic AC-IOL. Patients who have undergone phakic AC-IOL implantation may develop long?term endothelial cell loss  potentially leading to corneal decompensation and the need for corneal transplantation. Mechanical trauma to the endothelium at the time of surgery is believed to be a major cause of endothelial cell loss. In addition  chronic endothelial damage due to intermittent contact between the cornea and the IOL may also be a contributing factor. Corneal endothelium plays an important role in maintaining corneal transparency. Severe loss of endothelial cells can lead to stromal edema and bullous keratopathy. Lamellar endothelial keratoplasty has gained popularity for the management of such cases. , DOS Members, J-4251, DR.

Systemic infection markers were elevated  and MRI showed right-sided orbital cellulitis without intracranial extension. The patient showed improvement in periorbital swelling and pain  but vision did not recover (no light perception).  Conclusion:  Orbital cellulitis is a rare but complication of cataract surgery  especially in patients with systemic comorbidities. This case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis  aggressive antimicrobial therapy  systemic disease control  and  to mitigate the risk of permanent vision loss from complications such as CRAO., DOS Members, B-952, DR.

This case highlights a rare and deceptive presentation of full chamber hyphema that clinically mimicked a corneal ulcer.  Case Summary: A 4-year-old child presented to the emergency department four days after sustaining blunt trauma to the right eye from the wooden handle of a shovel. The child complained of ocular pain  redness  and diminished vision. On torchlight examination  a greenish opacity resembling a large corneal ulcer was noted. Surprisingly  the lesion did not stain with fluorescein on slit-lamp examination. Intraocular pressure appeared firm on digital palpation  and the anterior and posterior segments could not be visualized due to dense corneal opacity. A B-scan ultrasound showed no posterior segment pathology.  Initial management was directed toward a presumed pseudomonal corneal ulcer  however  despite symptomatic improvement  the clinical appearance remained static over two days. Given the lack of progression  the diagnosis was re-evaluated  and trauma-induced hyphema was suspected.  Intervention and Outcome: An examination under general anesthesia was planned. A side port was made  and anterior chamber wash was performed  revealing a full chamber hyphema with clotted blood filling the anterior chamber. The greenish hue was identified as total corneal blood staining.  Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of rethinking initial diagnoses when clinical findings diverge from expected progression. Total hyphema can mimic corneal pathology and should be considered in pediatric trauma  especially when ocular media is opaque., DOS Members, K-1239, DR.

Methods: This hospital-based observational comparative study included 100 COPD patients  divided into Group A (50 patients with normal pulmonary arterial pressure) and Group B (50 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension). Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations including IOP measurement were performed. COPD was assessed using GOLD staging  mMRC dyspnea scale  and COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Results: The mean IOP was significantly higher in Group B (16.00±3.69 mmHg) compared to Group A (13.1±2.95 mmHg) (p<0.001). Positive correlations were found between IOP and GOLD staging (r=0.270  p=0.003)  mMRC grading (r=0.301  p=0.001)  and CAT scores (r=0.389  p<0.001). On multivariate analysis  PAH maintained a significant positive effect on IOP (coefficient=3.076  p<0.001) after adjusting for confounding factors including hypertension and smoking. Conclusion: COPD patients with PAH have significantly higher IOP compared to those without PAH. Higher clinical scores indicating increased disease severity were associated with higher IOP. Regular ophthalmological screening is recommended for COPD patients  particularly those with PAH  to detect early IOP elevations and prevent potential glaucomatous damage., DOS Members, K-7706, Dr. Neha Khurana, neha.knew@gmail.com, 7009909238, GGSMCH  Faridkot  Punjab, DOS Members, D-1224, DR.

METHOD: Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy is known to cause massive sub-retinal bleed as well as breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage. The appearance of the vitreous can change as the hemorrhage progresses  with fresh blood appearing as dark clots and older hemorrhages appearing as a hazy or cloudy vitreous. We came across such a case with no fundal glow and a “black vitreous haemorrhage” that obscured visualization even per-operatively. As we began with 3-port pars plana vitrectomy  the black crumbs of condensed vitreous haemorrhage coated the posterior capsule of the natural clear lens of the patient  and an attempt to clean went in vain as the posterior capsule got chipped off by the vitrectomy cutter. This vitrectomy surgery then required the anterior segment backup. The lens was carefully phacoemulsified  preserving the remaining posterior capsule and a 3-piece IOL was implanted. The rest of the vitrectomy was completed thereafter  carefully peeling off the black clotted blood from the retinal surface.   CONCLUSION: Not all intraocular surgeries require a vitreo-retina backup. Sometimes it is the other way round. A perfect collaboration in times of trouble can give suprisingly favourable results. , DOS Members, S-8651, Dr. Shweta Singh, shwetancu@gmail.com, 9451130674, Centre for Sight  New Delhi, DOS Members, V-371, DR.

METHODS: Non-exudative macular neovascularization (ne-MNV) is characterized by evidence of macular neovascularization detectable on optical coherence tomography-angiography or the presence of a hot spot on ICGA  without leakage on FA and no macular fluid visible by OCT imaging. ne-MNV is an asymptomatic finding and serves as a risk factor for the development of exudative disease in eyes affected by age-related macular degeneration. We will discuss cases  one in which OCT angiography was used to detect a treatment naïve ne-MNV and another in which a quiescent ne-MNV was regularly monitored. Although the best visualization of ne-MNV occurs on ICGA  we describe OCT-Angiography as a quick  convenient  and non-invasive tool for the early detection and regular monitoring of these patients.    RESULTS: The patients were followed up over a substantial period over which some remained asymptomatic while others developed exudation and thereafter were treated with intravitreal anti-VEGFs.  CONCLUSION: Although the best visualization of ne-MNV occurs on ICGA  we describe OCT-Angiography as a quick  convenient  and non-invasive tool for regular monitoring of these patients and for early detection of complexes that may not appear on OCT images. Patients should be informed about the nature of the disease and regularly monitored so that treatment can be initiated should exudation occur. , DOS Members, S-8651, Dr. Shweta Singh, shwetancu@gmail.com, 9451130674, Centre for Sight  New Delhi, DOS Members, V-371, DR.

METHOD: This is the case of a macular hole in a myopic patient. The case began with the conventional 3-port pars plana vitrectomy with an aim to remove posterior hyaloid. It is customary to find anomalous posterior vitreous detachment in myopic patient which was identified with the use of 1st-stain triamcinolone acetate. Before jumping directly to internal limiting membrane peeling  we advocate the use of 2nd-stain trypan blue dye to detect any epiretinal membrane which can then be carefully peeled off. Lastly  the 3rd-stain brilliant blue dye is used to visualize the now-bare ILM which can then be trimmed to a flap or entirely removed from fovea as per surgeons’ discretion or as per case’s need. RESULT: By following the sequence of staining  we can reduce the surgeons struggle for finding the edge of the otherwise poorly stained membranes. The membranes removal can be ensured  and untoward trauma to the retina is also prevented while picking the edges off the surface. , DOS Members, S-8651, Dr. Shweta Singh, shwetancu@gmail.com, 9451130674, Centre for Sight  New Delhi, DOS Members, V-371, DR.

Methods: A 24-year-old female presented to the outpatient department with a cataractous lens dislocated into the anterior chamber. There was history of trauma. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated at 38 mm Hg  likely due to pupillary block caused by the dislocated lens. An initial attempt at laser peripheral iridotomy (PI) failed to reduce the IOP. The patient was subsequently scheduled for lens removal. Intraoperatively  there was total irido corneo lenticular touch and lens was successfully removed using aspiration through a side-port incision alone  avoiding larger incisions typically required for intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) and conjunctiva was preserved for future filtration surgery if needed. Entire procedure was completed by aspiration through temporal corneal incision. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that anteriorly dislocated cataract managed by using a minimally invasive  side-port aspiration  minimizing tissue trauma and preserving ocular structures. , DOS Members, P-3433, DR.

Method: Ten patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) underwent a series of three intense pulsed light (IPL) sessions  spaced two weeks apart  commencing from the initial treatment day (day zero). In conjunction with IPL therapy  a comprehensive treatment regimen was prescribed to optimize therapeutic outcomes. This regimen included oral antibiotics to address underlying bacterial contributions  topical eye drops comprising cyclosporine eye drops  steroid-antibiotic combination to reduce inflammation and prevent infection  and lubricating drops to enhance ocular surface hydration. Additionally  warm compressions were applied to promote meibomian gland function and facilitate glandular expression. IPL therapy yielded notable enhancements in ocular surface health  including reduced symptomatology and improved patient comfort  as evidenced by improved Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores. Additionally  IPL therapy improved meibomian gland function and enhanced tear production  as indicated by increased Schirmers test values. Furthermore  IPL treatment resulted in prolonged tear break-up time (TBUT) and non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT)  signifying enhanced tear film stability and improved meibomian gland function. Conclusion: IPL therapy targets the root causes of MGD  providing a safe and effective treatment that improves ocular surface health. Combined with adjunctive therapies like meibomian gland expression and omega-3 supplements  IPL offers a comprehensive approach to managing MGD and dry eye syndrome  reducing complication risks and improving outcomes., Non Members, , Shweta Chauhan, shwetatashi@gmail.com, 8006185745, Centre For Sight Eye Hospital  Safdarjung Enclave, DOS Members, P-450, Dr. J.K.S.

Out of the 20 patients 14 were female and 6 were male . In 5 patients the obstruction was unilateral and in 2 patients the obstruction was found to be  bilateral . In the remaining patients the lacrimal drainage system was found to be patent  Conclusion :CT dacryocystography emerges as more than just a diagnostic tool — it is a surgical compass. By precisely localizing obstructions within the lacrimal drainage system and offering a detailed anatomical roadmap  it empowers surgeons to plan and execute interventions with greater accuracy and confidence. This targeted insight not only enhances surgical precision but significantly elevates the chances of a successful outcome  turning uncertainty into clarity  and challenges into solutions.  , DOS Members, R-1660, Dr. K.

Among the modalities for its treatment  Nd:YAG laser hyaloidotomy is a non invasive method enabling rapid drainage of the obstructed macular area and improved vision within days. This case aimed to evaluate the benefits of Nd:YAG laser posterior hyaloidotomy as a method allowing rapid drainage of subhyaloid hemorrhage into the vitreous gel in pregnancy. Method : A 25-year-old pregnant female at 28 weeks of gestation presented to retina clinic with decrease in vision of 1- day duration in her right eye. It was sudden  painless and non-progressive. She had an episode of vomiting on the very day. Ophthalmic examination showed best corrected visual acuity of counting fingers (CF) in 1 meter in right eye (snellens chart).  On fundus examination a large pre-retinal hemorrhage of around 10 disc diameter was noted at macula. After full pupillary dilatation and topical anesthesia  5 spots of frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) with of 5 mJ power is applied near the inferior edge of the subhyaloid hemorrhage   avoiding retinal blood vessels and fovea. There is subsequent rapid resolution of premacular hemorrhage with immediate trickling of blood downwards into the inferior vitreous gel.  Conclusion: Nd:YAG laser posterior hyaloidotomy is a safe and effective procedure for rapid resolution of premacular subhyaloid hemorrhage  allowing rapid restoration of visual acuity  visualization of the underlying retina especially in pregnant women. , DOS Members, K-8661, Dr. GAURI KHARE, drgauri.khare@gmail.com, 7355148597, Centre for sight   New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 00:16:05]

The purpose of these cases is to highlight the involvement of posterior pole in herpetic retinopathy.  Material and methods:- 25-years-old healthy gentleman came with diminution of vision in his right eye (BCVA- Counting finger @1 meter) for 1 week . On examination  anterior segment was within normal limits along with normal intraocular pressure. Fundus evaluation revealed area of necrotizing retinitis patch with scattered superficial retinal hemorrhages below superior arcade threatening macula and moderate vitritis. Optical coherence tomography showed hyper-reflective retinal layers and neurosensory detachment at macula. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed disc leak and hyperfluorescence corresponding to retinitis lesion. Upon investigation  patient came positive for both IgG and IgM varicella zoster. Patient showed significant improvement with oral valacyclovir and clindamycin followed by oral prednisolone. Another patient 35-years-old male  one eyed  with 5 days history of diminution of vision in right eye (BCVA- Counting finger @1 meter) and no associated systemic illness. On examination  anterior segment was within normal limits along with normal intraocular pressure.  Fundus examination showed multiple patches of retinitis in peripapillay area and posterior pole along with supero-temporal and supero-nasal involvement. There were areas of occlusive vasculitis with multiple areas of hemorrhages in the posterior pole and mid-periphery. Although the blood investigation for infection came negative  patient showed remarkable improvement on oral valacyclovir and oral steroid.   Conclusion: - viral necrotizing retinopathy can cause wide spectrum of clinical manifestation. High clinical suspicion and early intervention is necessary to save vision.   , DOS Members, G-1007, Dr. AVNINDRA GUPTA, avnindra1970@yahoo.co.in, 9810169006, Centre for Sight   New Delhi, DOS Members, S-8651, Dr. Shweta Singh, shwetancu@gmail.com, 9451130674, Centre for Sight   New Delhi, DOS Members, V-371, DR.

However computed tomography detected an IOFB of 2.8mm in inferotemporal part posterior to the lens and patient underwent lens-sparing vitrectomy with IOFB removal by transcleral ‘magnetic handshake’ extraction with ILM forceps with perfluorocarbon liquid. Patient had a persistent best-corrected visual acuity of 6/6 and retina was unremarkable at final visit. Conclusion: Lens sparing Pars plana vitrectomy combined with IOFB extraction is an effective method for managing retained IOFB without traumatic cataract or sectoral involvement  as lens removal can posses greater postoperative inflammation and often leaves patient aphakic necessating additional surgery., DOS Members, A-1045, DR.

Agarwal Trophy Cornea Session , Cornea & Ocular Surface, SCAR-AI: Smartphone-Based Community Assessment of Corneal Opacities and Referral For Keratoplasty Using Artificial Intelligence, , Purpose: There is a large burden of corneal blindness  most of which is avoidable. Our purpose was to create an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based smartphone platform that can detect corneal opacities from smartphone images and identify patients requiring corneal transplantation  and to validate it in a community setting. Methods: This was a population-based cross-sectional observational study to create the AI application in which 2000 images of the cornea (1000 corneal opacities and 1000 normal) were used for training. The images were pre-processed and used to train an AI model. Once trained  the model was integrated into an Android application along with a questionnaire and tested in a population based cross sectional survey of 4954 participants to evaluate the applicability of the platform.  Results: The trained model achieved an accuracy of 92.25% with sensitivity  specificity  PPV and NPV above 90% during internal validation. In the field  the model demonstrated an accuracy of 94.59% in identifying corneal opacities  with a sensitivity and PPV of 72.4% (95% CI - 52.8% to 87.3%) and specificity and NPV of 97% (95% CI - 94.2% to 98.7%). Cohen’s Kappa was determined to be 0.6942 indicating a significant agreement of the AI model diagnosis with that of the ophthalmologist. There was excellent correlation between the model and ophthalmologist for determining the need for referral. Conclusions: We developed a novel smartphone image-based AI system  which is widely accessible and scalable and can be used by healthcare workers at the community level to connect underserved populations to sight-restoring interventions. , DOS Members, G-954, Dr. NOOPUR GUPTA, noopurgupta@hotmail.com, 9868449673, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS, DOS Members, GD-1824, DR.

Background: Viral keratitis is a common ocular infection typically associated with systemic illness or immunosuppression. However  atypical presentations in otherwise healthy individuals can pose a diagnostic challenge  often delaying appropriate treatment.  Case Description: A 54-year-old male with no history of systemic illness  ocular trauma  or foreign body exposure presented with painless diminution of vision in the right eye for 15 days. On examination  visual acuity in the affected eye was finger counting at 2 meters. Corneal sensations were markedly reduced. Slit-lamp examination revealed a 6.5 × 2.5 mm corneal ulcer with an overlying fibrinous membrane  keratic precipitates (KPs) in the anterior chamber  and endothelial involvement.  Based on clinical findings  a diagnosis of viral keratitis with endotheliitis was made. The patient was started on oral and topical antivirals  along with supportive therapy including homatropine  loteprednol  tobramycin  and moxifloxacin eye drops.  Results: The patient showed significant clinical improvement. By the third week  visual acuity improved to 6/36. The corneal ulcer had reduced in size  and the fibrinous membrane in the anterior chamber had resolved.  Conclusion: This case highlights that viral keratitis with endotheliitis can occur even in immunocompetent individuals. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of antiviral therapy are essential to achieving favorable visual outcomes., DOS Members, A-1095, Dr. ASHISH K.

Methods: We report the case of a 47-years old male who presented with gradual diminution of vision in both eyes (BE). He had history of using moderate power myopic glasses in BE. The best corrected visual acuity was 6/9 in right (RE) and left eye (LE)  respectively. The anterior segment examination revealed peripheral rim of endothelial pigment deposition leaving apart a clear zone at limbus (Figure 1A)  and posterior lens capsular pigment ring (Scheie stripe) at the site of zonular attachment (Figure 1B and 1C) in BE. Gonioscopy examination did not revealed typical TM pigmentation as seen in pigmentary dispersion syndrome (PDS) or pigmentary glaucoma (PG). Fundus evaluation revealed advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy in BE (Figure 1D). His highest IOP recorded was 34mmHg in RE and 37mmHg in LE  for which he was started on three topical anti-glaucoma medications. Results and Conclusions: The patient achieved desirable target IOP in BE  12mmHg in RE and 13mmHg in LE. Our patient had none of classical diagnostic triad for PDS. However  the diagnosis was made on the basis of anterior segment findings and glaucomatous disc findings. In conclusion  sometimes PDS or PG may have atypical presentation. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 10:39:09]

Traumatic Full-Thickness Macular Hole Following Blunt Ocular Injury During Birthday Celebration., , PURPOSE Even seemingly minor trauma should be properly evaluated as it can lead to sight threating complications like macular hole. METHODS A 21-year-old male presented with sudden diminution of vision in his left eye following blunt trauma from a belt accidentally hitting his left eye during his birthday celebration. Visual acuity was Finger counting at half meter in the left eye. Anterior segment examination revealed fixed & non reacting pupil  Cells 3 plus and presence of vossius ring. Fundus examination of the left eye shows clinical suspicion of macular hole with surrounding edema & commotio retinae present infero-temporally. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) confirmed the presence of a full-thickness macular hole without posterior vitreous detachment. Right eye anterior and posterior segment examination were unremarkable. The patient was managed conservatively with topical steroid  NSAID  cycloplegic and systemic steroid initially and monitored closely by clinical examination & OCT. After 5 months there was spontaneous closure of traumatic macular hole with foveal thinning with best corrected VA of 6/18.  CONCLUSION This case emphasizes that traumatic macular holes are more likely to close spontaneously. Early recognition & close monitoring are sufficient in traumatic macular hole as they have propensity for spontaneous closure. Interventions should only be done if required. , Non Members, , MOHAMMAD FARAZ AHMAD, mohammadfarazahmad@gmail.com, 9634285286, AMUIO  J N MEDICAL COLLEGE  AMU  ALIGARH, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 11:04:01]

Method A 36-year-old non diabetic non hypertensive male presented to opd with complains of sudden diminution of vision in right eye since 3 days. There was no associated history of fever rash  migraine  bleeding tendencies. Patient did not have personal and family history suggestive of sickle cell anemia and tuberculosis. He was a non-smoker Best corrected visual acuity of the patient in right eye was 6/36. The pupil was sluggish on reaction and grade 1 RAPD was present. On slit lamp examination anterior segment was unremarkable and IOP was 14mm Hg on applanation tonometry Fundus examination of right eye revealed whitening of the inferior retina along with lower half of macula along with arteriolar attenuation in the affected quadrant. Ocular examination of left eye was unremarkable. OCT of right eye revealed an increased thickening and hyper-reflectivity of the inner retinal layers in the inferior hemiretina involving the fovea. OCT of the left eye was within normal limits. Investigations of the patient were within normal limit except raised crp levels.  Conclusion  Hemiretinal artery occlusion in younger non diabetic population requires multidisciplinary approach and should raise suspicion for extensive evaluation to rule out embolic causes.

Methods: This was a prospective interventional study carried out in a tertiary centre for a period of one year. All PCG patients of ? 2 years of age with good corneal clearity (?grade 2) were included in the study and underwent 360 degree goniotomy. Patients with age > 2years  dense corneal haze  secondary childhood glaucoma  parents not willing to give consent were excluded from the study. Outcomes were defined as absolute success when IOP is ? 18 mmHg without any topical AGM  Qualified Success when IOP ?18mmHg on ? 2 AGMs and failure when IOP is >18 on 2 topical AGMs and requiring systemic therapy for control of IOP.   Results: Fivety two eyes of 32 patients were included in the study who underwent 360 degree goniotomy. The mean pre-operative IOP reduced from 23.28±5.98 mmHg to 11.03±5.06mmHg at 3 months  12.08±3.80mmHg at 6months  11.63±6.40mmHg at 9 months  12.54±5.09mmHg at 12months. The absolute success was achieved in 40.38% of eyes and qualified success was attained in 48% of eyes. Failure of the procedure was seen in 12% eyes. At 12months follow up  9.61% (5/52) eyes had uncontrolled IOP and underwent uneventful trabeculectomy. There was no sight threatening serious complications in any patient. Conclusion: 360 degree Goniotomy surgery may be considered as an initial procedure in PCG with clear cornea as it is minimally invasive and conjunctiva sparing surgery with very less complications. , DOS Members, A-3897, Dr. DEWANG ANGMO, dewang45@gmail.com, 9810896270, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS New Delhi, DOS Members, S-7821, Dr. Ekta Shaw, d.ektashaw@gmail.com, 8240551491, , Non Members, , PROF TANUJ DADA, tanujdada@gmail.com, , Dr Rajendra prasad centre for ophthalmic sciences AIIMS Delhi, DOS Members, S-317, Dr. NAMRATA SHARMA, namrata.sharma@gmail.com, 9810856988, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS Delhi, 2025-04-18 11:20:22]

He was on treatment for fungal corneal ulcer since 1 month. On examination the patient had a perforated corneal ulcer and denied any perception of light in his right eye.He had undergone a penetrating corneal transplant for Fuch s dystrophy in the same eye few years back. The patient underwent a Gunderson flap  as salvage procedure.After 2 weeks  the patient came back for a review and was asymptomatic. On examination  the extruded intraocular lens was seen masquerading as the cornea. The perforation was sealed by the intraocular lens which was also confirmed  on anterior segment OCT examination.     The patient was a diabetic and possible gradual exposure and extrusion of IOL occurred through the melted cornea. It appears that the optic of the IOL impacted between the ulcerated cornea and the upper lid  probably sealed the wound and allowed healing process under it  much in the same way a contact lens would have. In this case whole optic is firmly lying on the corneal surface without any detectable interface which proved to be a blessing in disguise for the patient and prevented an auto evisceration. , DOS Members, J-4251, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Retina, Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Retinal Disorders: A Novel Approach to Ischemia Modulation and Functional Retinal Recovery, , Purpose To evaluate the clinical efficacy and functional outcomes of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) as an adjunctive treatment in retinal disorders characterised by acute ischemic insult. The study focuses on four underexplored entities: Acute Macular Neuroretinopathy (AMN)  Purtscher-like Retinopathy  Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)  and Laser-Induced Retinal Injury. We aim to explore the potential of HBOT in modulating retinal ischemia and promoting visual recovery. Methods The series includes patients diagnosed with AMN  Purtscher-like Retinopathy  CRAO  and laser-induced retinal injury who underwent HBOT within <72 hours of symptom onset. Each patient received daily HBOT sessions (100% oxygen at 2.5 ATA for 90 minutes) for a minimum of 10 sessions. Functional outcomes were assessed using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  visual field analysis  while structural changes were documented using  OCT n OCTA. Baseline and post-therapy findings were compared to evaluate the degree of functional and anatomical recovery. Conclusion HBOT demonstrated promising results in modulating ischemia and enhancing functional retinal recovery in diverse retinal pathologies with acute ischemic mechanisms. Improvements were observed in visual acuity   and retinal morphology across all four conditions. These findings suggest that HBOT may offer a valuable  non-invasive adjunctive strategy in select ischemic retinal disorders. These findings support the potential role of HBOT as a targeted ischemia-modifying intervention in select retinal disorders., DOS Members, S-1119NS, DR.

Method: A pediatric patient presented with sudden vision loss and a small  poorly dilating pupil  which limited conventional fundus visualisation. Wide-field imaging using the Daytona system enabled clear visualisation of the posterior segment  allowing for accurate preoperative diagnosis of a retinal detachment with a dropped nucleus. A thick  adherent posterior hyaloid was encountered   limited the mobility of the retinal tissue. Skilled membrane dissection techniques  including bimanual manipulation and  forceps-assisted peeling  were employed to release the stuck hyaloid and expose the retinal breaks. Conclusion: Pediatric retinal detachment with a small pupil and associated dropped nucleus presents significant diagnostic and surgical challenges. Wide-field imaging plays a pivotal role in overcoming preoperative visualization barriers  enabling accurate diagnosis and surgical planning. Intraoperatively  managing the stuck hyaloid with precise membrane dissection techniques is critical to achieving successful retinal reattachment. The accompanying surgical video highlights these challenges and demonstrates effective management strategies  providing valuable insights into the surgical nuances of complex pediatric RD cases., DOS Members, S-1119NS, DR.

Methods: A prospective  interventional  and comparative study was done in a tertiary care center in northern India. A deep learning software (Netradeep) specially designed for quantification of retinal hard exudates compared the reduction of hard exudates following conventional and subthreshold micropulse yellow laser (577 nm) in non-center-involving diabetic macular edema. Subthreshold micropulse laser delivers short pulses with an “off” interval  which is known to cause less damage to retinal melanocytes. Non-center-involving diabetic macular edema patients were taken with central macular thickness less than 350nm. 20 eyes divided into controls and cases  followed up for a period of 1  3  and 6 months for evaluating the reduction in the macular thickness and reduction in hard exudates following laser treatment. Netradeep  a system that integrated data-driven DL and rule-based IP techniques for exudate segmentation. Various modifications in the software were done to improve the precision. At present   an ongoing modification of the software is being done by uploading more retinal hard exudate images to improve the accuracy. Conclusion: Mean CMT was significantly reduced in the perifoveal 3-6mm ETDRS circle in the control group in comparison to the cases. A significant reduction in the area of hard exudates from baseline to three months follow-up was calculated by machine-based learning software in the control group. DL software achieved remarkable performance  with a dice coefficient of 0.84. , DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , Vijay Kumar, vijay.smvdu@gmail.com, , IIT Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 12:06:35]

It was asssociated with diabetes mellitus  neurogenic bladder and sensory neural hearing loss. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of wolfram syndrome. On ocular examination vision in both eyes was finger counting at 1 metre and the pupillary reactions sluggish in both eyes. The intraocular pressure measured at the presentation was 25 and 23 mm Hg in right and left eye respectively. Anterior segment examination revealed cataractous changes in both eyes. On fundoscopy there was cupping of 0.8 with temporal disc palor in right eye and 0.5 cupping in left eye. After complete examination and investigations  the patient was started on anti-glaucoma medications Dorzolamide eyedrops 2% BD in both eyes and Brimonidine eye drop 0.2% BD in right eye and regular follow up advised for checking the intraocular pressures. The patient was consecutively followed up every week and IOP measured on each visit. The IOP was 18mmHg in right eye and 15mmHg in left eye on last follow up. Patient has been planned for cataract extraction after systemic stabilization.  Conclusion- Wolfram syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative genetic disease associated with diabetes mellitus  optic atrophy and deafness.

Agarwal Trophy , Glaucoma, Demographic Profile  Management Approaches and Outcome Analysis of Secondary Childhood Glaucoma in a Tertiary Eye Care Hospital in Northern India, , PURPOSE Secondary childhood glaucomas contribute significantly to visual morbidity in pediatric patients yet are frequently undiagnosed. While primary childhood glaucomas have received considerable attention  there remains a lack of understanding regarding optimal management strategies for secondary cases. This knowledge gap emphasizes the need for further investigation and development of effective treatment approaches tailored to the unique characteristics of secondary childhood glaucomas. METHODS In this retrospective study  we analyzed records of 115 pediatric patients who visited our center from March 2019 to September 2022. We assessed demographic data  best-corrected visual acuity  intraocular pressure  slit lamp and fundus findings  as well as diagnosis according to the Childhood Glaucoma Research Network (CGRN) Classification. We documented medical and surgical management approaches  evaluating outcomes in terms of complete success  qualified success  and failure. RESULTS The primary causes of secondary childhood glaucoma were acquired conditions (52.17%)  with glaucoma following vitreo-retinal surgery being most prevalent (19.13%)  followed by glaucoma associated with blunt trauma (17.39%). Among non -acquired ocular anomalies  Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome was most common (9.56%). Medical management was utilized in 52.56% of cases  while surgical intervention was done in 47.44%. Overall success was achieved in 80.55% of patients  while 19.45% experienced failure six months post-surgery. No major sight-threatening  surgical complications were reported. CONCLUSION The prompt identification and effective management of secondary childhood glaucoma are crucial in enhancing visual prognosis and  consequently  elevating the quality of life for pediatric patients., DOS Members, D-512, Dr. SUNEETA DUBEY, dubeysuneeta@hotmail.com, 9818224290, Dr Shroffs charity Eye Hospital Daryaganj j, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 14:23:17]

We report a case of a 56-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and bronchial asthma  who presented with diminution of vision and associated with headache since 3-4 months. Clinical examination revealed visual acuity 6/9  colour perception 5/26 and normal pupillary reaction in both eyes. Fundus examination was within normal limits. However  HVF 30-2 revealed that she had left-sided homonymus hemianopia  which developed into peripheral scotoma in last 3 months. Contrast enhanced Magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) of the brain and orbits was suggestive of Meningitis with intracranial hypertension. Findings from the optic nerve pointed to optic perineuritis. Crebrospinal fluid analysis and systemic workup revealed primary focus at right apex of lung and diagnosed as a case of Adenocarcinoma lung and active metastasis to meningeal layer in brain. In view of progressive field loss over last 4 months  patient was started on high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone  followed by an oral taper  resulting in significant visual improvement.  This case highlights the importance of differentiating OPN from other causes of optic neuropathy  particularly in patients with underlying malignancies  where both paraneoplastic and inflammatory etiologies must be considered and infective etiologies to be ruled out. Early diagnosis and prompt steroid therapy can lead to favourable outcomes  even in patients with complex medical histories. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 14:55:35]

Methods:?A clinical case of a middle-aged female presenting with gradually progressive  painless diminution of vision (left > right eye) over six months and distorted central vision for three months was evaluated. Initial history and general physical examination revealed no systemic illness or ocular trauma. Ocular assessment was conducted using OCT macula  perimetry  ERG  and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). Findings included characteristic flecks in the posterior pole and periphery. Differential diagnoses considered included Stargardts disease  cone-rod dystrophy  Best’s disease  pattern dystrophy  and age-related macular degeneration. However  fundus imaging findings and history were consistent with Fundus Flavimaculatus.  Conclusion:?Fundus Flavimaculatus  a variant of Stargardt’s disease  can present with subtle symptoms and mimic several macular dystrophies. This case highlights the utility of OCT and perimetry in narrowing the diagnosis  especially when classical fundus signs are evident. Early recognition is critical to counsel patients on prognosis and consider antioxidant therapy to potentially slow progression. The patient was started on oral antioxidants and advised regular follow-up for monitoring.

He was a diagnosed case of Juvenile angle open glaucoma with history of Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation in both eyes with failed optical keratoplasty in left eye. On examination  Visual acuity in the right eye was Hand movement close to face with accurate projection of rays and IOP of 4 mm Hg in the RE on 2 topical anti glaucoma medications. The patient had a posterior subcapsular cataract with shallow anterior chamber and signs of hypotony maculopathy and choroidal detachment in posterior segment evaluation. The patient was managed conservatively at first  which included discontinuation of topical anti glaucoma medications and initiation of topical and oral steroids. After 2 weeks of conservative management  hypotony had not resolved  therefore the patient was posted for RE phacoemulsification with AC reformation using viscocohesives. The patient gained vision with refraction up to 6/36 with refraction postoperatively with IOP 0f 10 mm Hg. The patient was kept on follow up and a recurrence of hypotony 2 months post operatively was noted. Therefore  the patient was posted for AGV tube stenting with 3-0 prolene suture. Postoperatively  the choroidal mounds and macular folds were reduced considerably. , Non Members, , Dewang Angmo, dewang45@gmail.com, 9810896270, AIIMS  Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 15:17:54]

Three such cases presented to us :  Case 1: A 5-year-old female was referred from pediatrics for fundus evaluation. She presented with facial and body hypopigmented maculopapular patches consistent with shagreen patches and ash leaf macules and had been diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis. Fundus examination revealed a greyish-yellow  dome-shaped lesion inferior to the optic disc in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a tumor-like proliferation involving the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and inner retinal layers  consistent with a retinal astrocytic hamartoma. Case 2: A 31-year-old female with tuberculosis  Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and tuberous sclerosis was referred from Urology. Fundus examination revealed a hypopigmented  elevated lesion superotemporal to the left optic disc. OCT findings were suggestive of astrocytic hamartoma. Case 3: An 11-year-old male with tuberous sclerosis presented for ocular evaluation. Fundus examination revealed a dome-shaped elevated lesion superior to and partially covering the right optic disc. OCT showed a highly elevated  hyperreflective lesion involving the inner retinal layers  characteristic of a astrocytic hamartoma. Conclusion: Tuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous syndrome often associated with benign tumors  including retinal astrocytic hamartomas. A high index of clinical suspicion and thorough ocular examination including OCT is essential in patients with TSC to ensure early diagnosis and monitoring of retinal involvement.  , DOS Members, BD-1478, Dr. VANDANA BALACHANDRAN, vandana_balachandran@yahoo.com, 9962253382, AIIMS Nagpur, Non Members, , Dr. Puja Hingorani-Bang, drpujabang@aiimsnagpur.edu.in, 9850553305, AIIMS Nagpur, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 15:18:22]

He was on treatment for fungal corneal ulcer since 1 month. On examination the patient had a perforated corneal ulcer and denied any perception of light in his right eye.He had undergone a penetrating corneal transplant for Fuch s dystrophy in the same eye few years back. The patient underwent a Gunderson flap  as salvage procedure.After 2 weeks  the patient came back for a review and was asymptomatic. On examination  the extruded intraocular lens was seen masquerading as the cornea. The perforation was sealed by the intraocular lens which was also confirmed  on anterior segment OCT examination.     The patient was a diabetic and possible gradual exposure and extrusion of IOL occurred through the melted cornea. It appears that the optic of the IOL impacted between the ulcerated cornea and the upper lid  probably sealed the wound and allowed healing process under it  much in the same way a contact lens would have. In this case whole optic is firmly lying on the corneal surface without any detectable interface which proved to be a blessing in disguise for the patient and prevented an auto evisceration.   , DOS Members, J-4251, DR.

Methods- A 30-year-old male presented for a second opinion following a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with silicone oil tamponade in his left eye  performed elsewhere for an inferior rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with a large inferotemporal break. On examination  best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 in the right eye and 1/60 in the left. Fundus evaluation revealed macula-off redetachment with the original inferotemporal break found open under the silicone oil. Given the patients age and phakic status  a decision was made to proceed with scleral buckling using a 180° inferior buckle combined with an encircling band. A standard peritomy was performed  and the inferotemporal break was localized and marked. Intraoperatively  a single-port passive silicone oil evacuation was employed  allowing for controlled titration of intraocular pressure before closure. Conclusion: This case highlights a strategic and effective alternative in the management of inferior redetachments under oil  especially in young phakic patients. Scleral buckling may serve as a viable technique  preserving the crystalline lens and avoiding repeat vitrectomy. This approach underscores the enduring relevance of buckling in the modern vitreoretinal era  particularly when individualized to patient anatomy and surgical history., DOS Members, S-7197, Dr. NAWAZISH FATMA SHAIKH, SHAIKH.NAWAZISH@GMAIL.COM, 9920098673, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences  AIIMS  Delhi, DOS Members, V-684, DR.

Methods: A 40-year-old diabetic male with a history of left orbital diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with external beam radiotherapy (30 Gy in 15 fractions) presented three years post radiation with gradually progressive diminution of vision and floaters in the left eye. Clinical examination revealed florid neovascularization at the posterior pole with multiple microaneurysms and dispersed vitreous hemorrhage and fluorescein angiography (FA) revealed multiple leakages. The patient underwent panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)  pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. Results: Initial fundus examination revealed florid proliferative radiation retinopathy with disc and retinal neovascularization  leading to vitreous hemorrhage. After PRP and PPV  best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 6/9. Six weeks later  OCT and FA demonstrated a sub-foveal CNVM characterized by late leakage and a hyperreflective subretinal lesion  with a drop in visual acuity to 3/60. He was given intravitreal Anti-VEGF injection  which led to complete regression of the CNVM and gain of BCVA to 6/60. No recurrence was observed at six month follow-up. Conclusion: Proliferative radiation retinopathy occurs in up to 7% of eyes following ocular irradiation and may rarely be complicated by CNVM formation. Identification of CNVM requires imaging  including OCT and FA  and prompt treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF can yield excellent anatomical and functional outcomes.

We present a case of a wooden IOFB with delayed presentation  managed surgically with excellent visual recovery.   Method:   A 62-year-old male presented two weeks after a wooden prick injury to the right eye  with vision reduced to FC at 50 cm. Anterior segment examination revealed a corneal entry scar (inferior quadrant)  posterior synechiae  and posterior subcapsular cataract. Fundus evaluation showed the foreign body lodged along the inferotemporal vascular arcade  surrounded by hemorrhage. The patient underwent lensectomy + pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) + IOFB removal + endolaser (EL) + silicone oil injection (SOI). Perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) was used to stabilize the posterior pole during foreign body extraction.   Results:   Postoperatively  the patient recovered smoothly  with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improving from 6/18 at one month to 6/9 at three months. Silicone oil removal (SOR) with fluid-air exchange (FAX) was performed after three months  with final BCVA stabilizing at 6/9.   Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of timely surgical intervention in traumatic wooden IOFBs to prevent complications. The use of PFCL for retinal stabilization  and silicone oil tamponade contributed to anatomical and functional success. Even with delayed presentation  structured surgical planning can restore near-normal vision  emphasizing the need for urgent management in similar cases. , DOS Members, SD-1608, Dr. RUSHIL KUMAR SAXENA, RUSHILKR@GMAIL.COM, 8812828568, Dr. Shroff`s Charity Eye Hospital, DOS Members, YD-2017, Dr. Alka Yadav, alkay341@gmail.com, 8800109006, Dr. Shroff`s Charity Eye Hospital, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 15:48:34]

METHODS: A 13-year-old female presented with acute blurring of vision  redness  and watering in the right eye for three days. Comprehensive clinical history and ocular examination were conducted  including slit-lamp and fundoscopic evaluations. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus photography revealed retinochoroiditis  perivascular sheathing  and vitreous inflammation. Laboratory investigations included CBC  ESR  ELISA for Toxoplasma IgM  and chest X-ray. Based on ocular findings and dietary history (non-vegetarian diet including beef)  a diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis was made. The patient was treated with a combination of antibiotics (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole)  corticosteroids (oral Prednisolone and topical drops)  and supportive care.  CONCLUSION: Ocular toxoplasmosis is a leading cause of infectious posterior uveitis and can present with characteristic retinal lesions and vitreous inflammation. In this case  the “headlight in fog” appearance  OCT findings  and dietary history supported the diagnosis. Prompt initiation of anti-toxoplasma therapy and corticosteroids resulted in significant clinical improvement.

This can be caused by the ingestion  inhalation or absorption of silver or metal through the skin and is considered as an occupational hazard. We present two cases of suspected corneal metallosis who were managed with stripping of the a thin layer adjacent to the endothelium.  Background: Two middle aged gentlemen working in a photo processing company presented to us with dimunition of vision in both eyes. On ocular examination both eyes showed a pinpoint slate gray appearance at the level of the Descemet s membrane and the endothelium with immature senile cataract. During stripping  a friable membrane was removed along with phacoemulsification.The DM appeared to be intact on the postoperative visits on ASOCT and the corneal edema resolved with a preserved endothelial cell count. The HPE showed a distinct layer of deposits like a membrane which was beneath the layer of the descemets and endothelium and above the anterior lens capsule. Staining with rhodamine silver was suggestive of either silver/ copper deposits.  Conclusion: Ocular argyrosis presents as a distinct membrane posterior to the Descemet and the corneal endothelium which can be peeled off without the requirement of any additional endothelial keratoplasty. Thus  removing the potential risk of long-term complications of ocular metallosis and providing a histopathologically proven diagnosis of the condition which can be used to spread awareness regarding the hazard posed while working in silver dominant industries.  , DOS Members, J-4251, DR.

No history of fever  other systemic complaints. The patient reported no associated pain  redness  or trauma  and had no history of fever  cough  or other systemic symptoms. The BCVA was 6/6 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye. Upon examination  the anterior segment of both eyes appeared normal. The fundus of the right eye was unremarkable. Fundus examination of the LE revealed characteristic pigmented stippling at the fovea of 1/3 disc diameter in size surrounded by hypopigmented halo. OCT demonstrated a dome shaped hyper-reflective lesion at the photoreceptor outer segment layer disrupting the ellipsoid zone and inter-digitation zone. Based on the findings  diagnosis of left-eye Acute Retinal Pigment Epitheliitis (ARPE)/ Krill’s disease was made. LE ARPE. The patient was managed conservatively. On follow-up  the size of the lesion gradually decreased. OCT imaging at day 15 showed a reduction of lesion in both hyperreflectivity and height  with complete resolution observed by one month. The vision had improved to 6/6 and the patient was asymptomatic by this time. Conclusion Krill’s disease is a self-limiting condition with favourable prognosis  typically resulting in recovery of VA and retinal integrity. Due to its rarity  the disease is often underdiagnosed.

Result: 30 eyes of patients with compound myopic astigmatism in the age group 22-34 years underwent SMILE. The preoperative spherical refractive error was -4.3±1.9 DS (range -1.5 to -9DS) and a cylindrical error of -0.50±0.7DS. The post-operative UCVA was 6/6 in 70% eyes (n=21) and 6/9 in 30% (n=9) with a residual spherical and cylindrical error of -0.38 DS and -0.50 DC respectively. The HOA RMS decreased from -0.43µ preoperatively to -0.2µ postoperatively (p=0.006). The patients scored better in the NEI-RQL (National Eye Institute–Refractive Error Quality of Life survey) post- surgery. Conclusion: The early outcomes of SMILE using VISUMAX 800 femtosecond laser shows promising results with a good objective and subjective outcome.

On clinical examination both eyes have features of chronic granulomatous uveitis with presence of mutton fat keratic precipitates and seclusio pupillae. On general physical examination  patient was cachexic with history of loss of apetite. Further examination revealed non-inflammatory mass with size of approximately 10cm*8cm with ill-defined margin. On further questioning patient told that size of mass was gradually increasing and for which patient took homeopathy treatment. Surgery consultation done  mass was diagnosed as extramammary tissue as a first diagnosis.  FNAC was done which revealed AFB positive by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining and diagnosed as tubercular lymphadenitis. HRCT chest suggestive of old infective changes. Based on this  ATT was started (HRZE). Subsequently  once intraocular inflammation was controlled with anti-tubercular therapy and steroids  the patient underwent phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation in both eyes (photograph documents will be provided) RESULT: The size of paraxial mass gradually decreasing after starting ATT and within 6-8 weeks mass was completely subsided with improvement of general physical condition    CONCLUSION: this case highlight that any uveitis patient need complete general physical examination including any tubercular lesion anywhere in the body and  need for multidisciplinary approach to find out exact etiology which helps to confirm diagnosis and early management. , DOS Members, K-639, Dr. GOPAL KRUSHNA DAS, dasgk2002@yahoo.co.in, 7838908128, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE AND GTB HOSPITAL DELHI 110095, Non Members, , P K SAHU, sahupramod52c@gmail.com, 9868399779, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE AND GTB HOSPITAL DELHI 110095, DOS Members, SD-1938, Dr. ISHA SHARMA, ophisha10@gmail.com, 7011381458, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE AND GTB HOSPITAL DELHI 110095, Non Members, , Tadu Nampi, official.nampi@gmail.com, 7827797643, UCMS AND GTB HOSPITAL, 2025-04-18 16:04:28]

BCVA of LE was hand movement close to face.  On examination  mature white cataract was noted with no view to fundus. To assess the posterior segment  an ultrasonography (USG) B-scan was performed  which revealed a cystic lesion with high reflective internal echoes  highly suggestive of ocular cysticercosis. Based on the findings  the patient was planned for phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation and core vitrectomy with cyst removal under steroid cover. Surgery went uneventful  but surprisingly  no cystic lesion was found during the procedure. The case was concluded  and the patient had a smooth recovery  regaining good visual acuity of 6/6. Repeat USG B scan in post operative period showed no cystic lesion with completely normal investigations. In literature  there is no reported case of a cyst vanishing during surgery when it was well-documented before the procedure. This raises several possibilities. One is  self-resolution of the cyst before surgery  which was ruled out by two different USG B-scan reports from separate ophthalmology institutes. Another possibility is the loss of the cyst during cataract surgery  but this was also not the case  as the phacoemulsification procedure was uneventful  with an intact posterior capsule and a posterior intraocular lens securely placed in the bag. Finally  the possibility that the nasal B-scan echo of the cataractous lens might mimic a cyst echo was also considered  but the presence of a high-reflective scolex echo ruled out that possibility as well., DOS Members, J-7240, DR.

Methods: Two preterm infants with aggressive ROP(AROP) and bleb-like TRD involving half of zone 1 in both eyes received intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (ranibizumab). Both cases were followed closely with serial fundus examinations. Outcomes measured included anatomical resolution of TRD  progression of vascularization  disease reactivation  and adverse events such as fibrovascular tissue contraction (‘crunch’). Results: A 27-week preterm infant  birth weight 900gms and a 32-week preterm infant  birth weight 1.4kg both presented at 39 weeks post-menstrual age with bilateral half zone AROP with bleb-like TRD. In the first case  both eyes showed total resolution of TRD following anti-VEGF injection. However  the infant developed zone 1 reactivation in both eyes 6 weeks later  necessitating repeat Bevacizumab injection and laser in avascular retina. In the second case  one eye demonstrated total TRD resolution  while the fellow eye experienced a rapid crunch with worsened traction that could not be salvaged. Zone 1 sparing laser was done in the eye with complete TRD resolution. The vascularization reached till the junction of zone 1 and zone 2 in all 3 eyes with TRD resolution at last follow-up and no reactivation. Conclusion: Anti-VEGF therapy can lead to anatomical improvement in selected bleb-like half-zone 1 TRD cases in ROP. However  outcomes remain variable  with potential for adverse contraction  warranting close monitoring and timely surgical intervention., DOS Members, KD-1668, Dr. DEVESH KUMAWAT, DEVESHKUMAWAT21@GMAIL.COM, 9711797688, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi  India, Non Members, , Dr. Ritweez Sahu, rits.wiz@gmail.com, 9819916043, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi  India, Non Members, , Dr. Shorya V Azad, shoryaazad@gmail.com, 9990046277, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi  India, DOS Members, V-7729, Dr. SAURABH VERMA, DR.SAURABH.VERMA.SV@GMAIL.COM, 9910402435, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi  India, 2025-04-18 16:25:12]

The case underscores the importance of a structured evaluation in uveitic conditions with a focus on infectious etiology  particularly toxoplasmosis  which remains a common cause of posterior uveitis worldwide.  Method: A 25-year-old female presented with complaints of blurred vision in the left eye. Ocular examination revealed vitritis and a yellow-white lesion at the posterior pole adjacent to a pigmented scar  suggestive of active retinochoroiditis. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed retinal thickening and hyperreflective dots in the vitreous. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) indicated leakage from retinal vessels adjacent to the lesion. Serological testing confirmed Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity. Based on clinical and imaging findings  a diagnosis of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis was made. The patient was treated with pyrimethamine  sulfadiazine  and folinic acid along with oral corticosteroids. Serial fundus imaging was used for monitoring.  Conclusion: This case demonstrates the characteristic presentation of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis and the importance of integrating clinical findings with imaging and serology to confirm the diagnosis. Timely initiation of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapy leads to good visual recovery and reduces the risk of recurrence. Multimodal imaging aids not only in diagnosis but also in monitoring therapeutic response.

Methods: A prospective interventional study was done after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institute Ethics Committee  AIIMS  ND. 10 patients were recruited after taking written informed consent from parents  and intralesional bleomycin injections were given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg maximum up to 3 times over a 6-week interval after baseline evaluation and were kept on 6-month follow-up. Results: The median age of presentation was 9.50 months  with a female-to-male ratio of 9:1. Upper lid involvement (n=8) and superficial lesions (n=7) were predominant. 20% of patients had a reduction in ptosis. No patient had strabismus. The mean percentage reduction in area (cm²) at 3 months and 6 months was 27.9 and 34.8  respectively . 50% of patients had color regression. There was no statistically significant improvement in visual acuity. The majority (60%) of patients showed a moderate response. Conclusions: Capillary hemangiomas are self-resolving  but early treatment may be necessary for large lesions to prevent visual impairment or amblyopia. We evaluated the effect of intralesional bleomycin injections in patients who were non-responsive to propranolol. The treatment demonstrated a favorable side-effect profile and resulted in statistically significant reductions in lesion area. In conclusion  intraleural bleomycin can be considered a safe  moderately effective  minimally invasive treatment option., DOS Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 16:38:21]

Methods: A 37-year-old myopic female presented with sudden  painless  bilateral vision loss of one-day duration. There was no history of systemic illness  trauma  redness  or prior ocular treatment. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motions close to face (HMCF) in both eyes. Intraocular pressure was normal. Anterior segment was quiet bilaterally. Vitritis was grade 1 in the right eye and trace in the left (SUN classification). Fundus revealed mild disc hyperemia (right eye) and multiple creamy white placoid choroidal lesions at the posterior pole  involving the macula bilaterally. OCT showed NSD with lesions at the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. Fundus fluorescein angiography demonstrated early hypofluorescence followed by late hyperfluorescence at lesion sites.  Results: A provisional diagnosis of VKH versus atypical APMPPE was made. Due to disc edema and NSD  intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated  followed by tapering oral steroids. Vision improved to 6/9 in both eyes within three days  with OCT confirming resolution of NSD.  Conclusion: This case illustrates an atypical white dot syndrome mimicking VKH. Early steroid therapy led to rapid anatomical and visual recovery  highlighting the importance of timely intervention in such diagnostic dilemmas., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 17:18:25]

Methodology: A 2-year-old male presented with a rapidly progressive  painful swelling of the left upper eyelid and high-grade fever. Clinical examination and imaging revealed an orbital abscess. Simultaneously  the child exhibited signs of left distal femoral osteomyelitis. Hematological investigations showed leukocytosis with anemia. Blood and pus cultures confirmed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surgical drainage of the orbital abscess and debridement of the femoral infection were performed under general anesthesia. The patient was treated with targeted intravenous antibiotics  including vancomycin  piperacillin-tazobactam  and metronidazole.  Conclusion: This case illustrates a rare manifestation of orbital cellulitis secondary to hematogenous spread from a distant osteomyelitic site in a pediatric patient. Prompt recognition  surgical intervention  and targeted antimicrobial therapy led to full recovery without recurrence. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for distant sources in cases of orbital cellulitis with atypical presentation. , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 18:06:17]

Methods: A 28-year-old male presented with a history of ocular trauma from a nail while working in a stapler factory. Primary corneal laceration repair had been performed elsewhere. On examination  he had a traumatic cataract  vitreous hemorrhage on ultrasonography  and a long metallic FB on CT scan  partly within the vitreous cavity and partly retrobulbar  breaching the posterior scleral coat. A two-stage surgical approach was planned. Results: In the first stage  cataract extraction and media-clearing vitrectomy were performed  leaving the eye aphakic with an intact anterior capsular rim. The exit wound was localized in the inferonasal mid-periphery. In the second stage  the 22 mm FB was carefully oriented along a limbal wound and removed using a foreign body forceps assisted by an external magnet. A multipiece intraocular lens was implanted in the sulcus. Laser photocoagulation was applied around the exit wound  followed by silicone oil tamponade. At one-month follow-up  the retina remained attached  and best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/40. Conclusion: Perforating FB injuries with traumatic cataract present complex challenges requiring individualized  staged surgical management. Preoperative planning  careful FB manipulation  and appropriate intraocular tamponade are crucial for successful anatomical and visual outcomes. This case underscores the importance of meticulous surgical technique in managing such posterior segment injuries., DOS Members, V-7729, Dr. SAURABH VERMA, DR.SAURABH.VERMA.SV@GMAIL.COM, 9910402435, AIIMS Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 18:57:01]

It occurs due to blockage of valves present in nasolacrimal duct. Here we report a case of bilateral sac swelling in a neonate. CASE PRESENTATION A 40 days old male baby was brought by his mother to the eye OPD with chief complaints of swelling over nasolacrimal sac area since 7 days. The patient had fever that lasted for 1 day. There was no history of respiratory distress or other medical illness. On ocular examination  both lids showed matted eyelashes and mucopurulent discharge. Swelling near medial canthal area was seen of size 4mm×3mm×2mm in Right Eye and 7mm×5mm×3mm in Left Eye which was associated with redness  tenderness and local rise of temperature. The swelling in left eye subsided immediately after starting treatment.  MANAGEMENT The conjunctival swab was sent for microbiological testing which showed streptococcal infection in right eye and no organism in left eye.  Diagnosis of bilateral congenital dacryocoele with acute dacryocystitis in right eye  was made. The baby was admitted and intravenous antibiotics were started  along with antipyretics. OUTCOME. Spontaneous drainage of right sided nasolacrimal sac swelling was seen 2 days later and spontaneous healing of left sided nasolacrimal sac swelling was seen 1 day later due to it being non- infective. The baby recovered after 7 days after which bilateral gentle Criggler massage was started. CONCLUSION Timely diagnosis and management of dacryocystocele can prevent further complications., Non Members, , Prof. Ajab Dhabarde, ajabdhabarde@mgims.ac.in, 9096966243, MGIMS WARDHA, DOS Members, S-340, DR.

Conventional approaches to address this issue are use of 6mm microcannula  sclerotomy-assisted drainage or partly inserted 23G microcannula 6 to 8mm behind the limbus. We describe a modified transconjunctival trocar-microcannula approach for drainage of serous CD.  Methods: The surgical steps are highlighted in 2 cases of retinal detachment with CD who underwent micro-incisional 25-gauge vitrectomy with drainage of serous CD. Location of serous CD mounds is confirmed either just prior to surgery using indirect ophthalmoscope or intraoperatively using endo-illumination and wide-angle viewing system through one safely placed microcannula (placed in quadrant with least CD height). Under positive pressure from anterior chamber maintainer or infusion in the vitreous cavity  a valved trocar-microcannula is inserted at 4mm from the limbus at almost 10 degree to the scleral surface  preferably in the quadrant with maximum CD. The trocar handle is retracted as soon as the microcannula is inserted 50% of its length into the sclera. Vent is then placed into the microcannula and microcannula position is adjusted. Results: Placement of vent into the microcannula releases the serous fluid from suprachoroidal space immediately. Vented gas forced infusion and partial retraction of the microcannula ensures near complete drainage of CD. Vitrectomy procedure is then continued safely.  Conclusions: Modified transconjunctival trocar-microcannula approach is less invasive and safer approach for drainage of serous choroidals during vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment., DOS Members, V-7729, Dr. SAURABH VERMA, DR.SAURABH.VERMA.SV@GMAIL.COM, 9910402435, AIIMS Delhi, DOS Members, AD-1420, DR.

We present the case of a 7-year-old boy diagnosed with bilateral microspherophakia presenting with progressive myopia  intermittent headaches  and raised intraocular pressure (IOP).  Clinical evaluation revealed small spherical lenses with zonular laxity  shallow anterior chambers  and IOPs in the mid-30s mmHg range  despite maximum tolerated medical therapy. Gonioscopy showed occludable angles with intermittent angle closure. Initial management focused on IOP control with topical agents and cycloplegics to pull the lens-iris diaphragm posteriorly. Regular monitoring of optic nerve head  visual fields (where cooperative)  and axial length was maintained.  With persistent angle crowding  progressive optic nerve cupping  and poor medication tolerance  a decision was made to proceed with clear lens extraction via phacoaspiration with in-the-bag IOL implantation. Anterior vitrectomy was avoided as the posterior capsule remained intact and vitreous stability was preserved.  Postoperatively  IOP stabilized without medications  and the anterior chamber deepened significantly with open angles. This case emphasizes key clinical decision points: – When to maximize medical therapy and observe in early stages – How to time surgical intervention before irreversible angle damage occurs – The importance of tailored surgery to preserve anatomy in a pediatric eye  This case underscores the dynamic nature of glaucoma management in microspherophakia and the importance of timely intervention in preserving vision and ocular development., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 19:04:18]

PKAN is characterized by the accumulation of iron in the brain. The clinical presentation of PKAN can be classified into two types: classic and atypical. Our patient is an example of classical type of PKAN who presented with pigmentary retinopathy and was investigated further for genetic analysis Conclusion This case report emphasizes that patients with retinal pigmentary retinopathy should be evaluated comprehensively. Ophthalmologists should assess for associated systemic features and consider referring patients for syndromic evaluation. Genetic analysis is crucial for diagnosing retinal pigmentary degenerations. Genetic counseling for parents regarding the risks of consanguineous marriage and the potential for other children to develop the disease is also important., DOS Members, KD-1140, DR.

She had a history of blunt trauma to the left eye (LE) several years prior and was found to have bilateral signs of pigmentary glaucoma  with angle recession in the LE on gonioscopy.  Initial management included maximally tolerated topical therapy (MMT) and YAG peripheral iridotomy (PI) to relieve reverse pupillary block often seen in pigment dispersion. However  IOP remained poorly controlled in the LE  with optic nerve changes continuing to progress.  Given the dual mechanism—pigmentary outflow resistance and structural angle damage from prior trauma—a trabeculectomy was performed in the LE with adjunctive mitomycin-C. Surgery was uneventful  and the patient achieved good IOP control postoperatively without medications.  This case highlights the importance of a multifactorial approach in young glaucoma patients  particularly when coexisting mechanisms complicate the clinical picture. It also underscores: – The need for careful gonioscopic evaluation in all young patients with asymmetric glaucoma – That medical and laser therapy may be insufficient in angle recession with trabecular dysfunction – The role of early surgical intervention to prevent irreversible optic nerve damage  A valuable teaching case for both glaucoma specialists and general ophthalmologists  especially in balancing pigmentary dynamics with trauma-induced angle pathology.  , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 19:12:22]

Agarwal Trophy , Oculoplasty, Rare association of primary orbital melanocytic masses associated with Oculodermal Melanocytosis: A Report of Two Cases, , Purpose: Most orbital melanomas are secondary to uveal or conjunctival origin. We report two unusual cases of orbital melanocytic lesions  both associated with longstanding periocular pigmentation suggestive of oculodermal melanocytosis. Methods: Case report of two primary orbital melanocytic lesions associated with oculodermal melanocytosis Results: A 26-year-old pregnant woman with an eight-year history of left eye proptosis showed significant progression of same in the first trimester. On examination she had conjunctival and periocular pigmentation. CEMRI indicated hyperintense T1 and hypointense T2 lesions in the orbit and ipsilateral temporal lobe  with bright contrast enhancement. Both lesions were metabolically inactive on FDG-PET scan. Another 30-year-old male with left eyelid melanocytosis and presented with progressive proptosis for four years. CEMRI showed similar morphology and enhancement pattern of orbital mass. Histopathological examination was suggestive of melanoma in both cases. Conclusion: Orbital and or intracranial melanocytic lesion may be associated with oculodermal melanocytosis. The long duration of complaints in both our cases and metabolic inactivity of FDG PET makes us wonder if these were in fact orbital melanocytomas that mimicked melanomas on histopathology.

The review of literature emphasises that diagnosis and management of Retinoblastoma can be difficult in older children and is often misdiagnosed. Retinoblastoma may extend into the suprasellar region via optic nerve. However  the occurrence is extremely rare especially in older children with mortality in all cases reported. An eight year old child presented with diminution of vision in Left eye and headache since one year. The Contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CEMRI) revealed a large lobulated mass in left globe appearing hypointense on T1w and hyperintense on T2w images and involving intraorbital intracanalicular  prechiasmatic and chiasmatic segment of left optic nerve with intracranial extension and an associated suprasellar mass. Based on Ophthalmological evaluation and radiologic imaging characteristics a diagnosis of Left globe Retinoblastoma with Intracranial extension was made. The child underwent chemoreduction for the same.

Three  patients were post penetrating keratoplasty(PK) and 2 patients were post endothelial keratoplasty. All the patients presented with graft rejection with an average of 6 – 12 months of initial graft and had no associated ocular comorbidities. They failed to clear up after receiving the standard of care treatment consisting of oral and topical steroids and had persistent corneal graft edema. The patients were being considered and awaiting a repeat keratoplasty. Topical Ripasudil(ROCK Inhibitor) 0.4% qid was started for all these patients in the interim period as an academic endeavour to assess it s efficacy in reducing corneal edema. •	Results: All 5 patients showed reduction in corneal edema  graft clearing and an improvement in visual acuity preventing the need of regrafts over 3 months after initiation of topical Ripasudil. •	Conclusion: The regenerative action of ROCK inhibitors on corneal endothelium may have a role in the management of graft rejections.

Herein we present two unusual cases of benign lacrimal sac tumors with aim to highlight their clinical features and diagnostic challenges. Methods: Case report presenting clinico-demographic profile  histology and radiological data of two cases of lacrimal sac tumors. Result: Two middle-aged women  aged 25 and 33 years  presented with complaint of painless  progressive swelling in the left inferomedial orbital region without any history of epiphora  epistaxis or hemolacrimia. Clinical examination revealed a firm  well-defined mass in the lacrimal sac area with superotemporal globe dystopia in both cases. CT-DCG/CECT revealed a mass in the lacrimal sac region. A provisional diagnosis of lacrimal sac tumor was made. Both patients underwent surgical excision with dacryocystectomy and histopathological evaluation confirmed a solitary fibrous tumor in one case and a neurofibroma in the other. Conclusion: Benign tumors of the lacrimal sac such as SFT and neurofibroma are exceedingly rare and may mimic chronic dacryocystitis or mucocele. Benign lacrimal tumors may not produce epiphora  and clinical and radiological findings may not be conclusive with regard to the location of such large tumors (intra or peri sac). The best approach to management of such large tumors is intra-operative evaluation with prompt dacryocystectomy in cases with large sac tumors., DOS Members, T-8185, Dr. Himani Thakur, himanithakur14@gmail.com, 918988000000, Dr RP Center  AIIMS New Delhi, DOS Members, P-453, DR.

In adults  the risk factors for abducens nerve palsy can be categorized as vasculopathic or non-vasculopathic. Vasculopathic risk factors are more common in older patients and may include conditions such as diabetes. On the other hand  non-vasculopathic causes can be present in adults and children and may involve various factors such as trauma  inflammation  or compression. The sixth cranial nerve runs a long course from the brainstem to the lateral rectus muscle. Based on the location of an abnormality  other neurologic structures may be involved with the pathology related to this nerve. Esotropia resulting from sixth cranial nerve palsy can substantially impact an individual’s visual acuity and overall quality of life. If the condition does not resolve in 6–10 months  surgical intervention may be necessary. Various muscle surgeries may be considered  with vertical rectus muscle transposition emerging as the primary option for treatment of complete palsy. However  this technique carries the risk of anterior segment ischemia and post-surgery deviations.

Method: Medical records of cases diagnosed with probable/possible/definite IgG4-ROD were reviewed. Result: A total of 19 cases (14 adult and 5 paediatric) were evaluated during the study period. Among the adults  43% had definite  50% probable  and 7% possible IgG4 ROD  while among children  20% had definite  40% probable  and 40% possible IgG4-ROD. There was a slight male preponderance (52%) with the mean age at diagnosis being 39±14.5 years for adults and 8.6±2 years for children. Painless proptosis was the most common symptom in both adults (64%) and children (100%). Unilateral involvement was more frequent in both groups  with all paediatric cases showing unilateral disease.

All patients presented with unilateral proptosis  with one also exhibiting associated strabismus. Fundus examination revealed optic nerve coloboma in all patients  with additional findings of chorioretinal lacunae and myelinated nerve fibre in one case. Associated ocular anomalies included persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) in two patients—one affecting the same eye as the cyst and the other involving the fellow eye. Orbital ultrasonography revealed large retrobulbar echolucent cysts with low internal reflectivity  indenting the posterior globe. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbit demonstrated well-defined intraconal cystic lesions along the intraorbital course of the optic nerve in all cases. The cysts showed fluid signal intensity on all sequences  were associated with microphthalmos  and lacked any enhancing solid components or diffusion restriction. One patient underwent enucleation with cyst excision  and histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of optic nerve colobomatous cyst.

[AA25-860, DOS Members, DD-2251,  Deepsekhar Das, doc.deep.das@gmail.com, 8375047749, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, , Free Paper - Dr. Arjun Narang Award, Ocular Oncology, Eye of the AI Storm: Unmasking Chatbot Truths in Ocular Oncology, , Purpose To evaluate and compare the performance of three advanced AI chatbots—Deepseek v3  ChatGPT 4o  and Gemini 2.0—in answering clinically relevant questions in ocular oncology  focusing on accuracy  completeness  readability  verbosity  real?world applicability in the Indian context  and overall reliability ? .  Methods In this cross?sectional observational study at a tertiary eye institute in Northern India  ocular oncology faculty developed five standardized clinical prompts covering choroidal melanoma  ocular surface squamous neoplasia  retinoblastoma  sebaceous cell carcinoma  and basal cell carcinoma. Each prompt incorporated patient demographics  symptom duration  medical and family history  and relevant diagnostic data. On the same day  prompts were input into Deepseek v3  ChatGPT 4o  and Gemini 2.0  responses were saved verbatim. Two independent faculty members scored each answer using a predefined proforma assessing:  Correctness (absolutely correct / partially correct / wrong) Completeness (complete / incomplete) Readability (Flesch?Kincaid Ease scores  word and sentence counts) Irrelevant content (some / none) Applicability (direct usability in the Indian clinical setting) Reliability (1–5 scale) Statistical analyses included Kruskal–Wallis tests for correctness and reliability  and one?way ANOVA with Levene’s test for readability parameters.  Results All three models achieved a mean correctness score of 3.4 ± 0.49  indicating comparable accuracy. However  4 of 5 responses per model were deemed incomplete. Deepseek v3 yielded the highest and most consistent readability (mean Flesch ease 38.0)  whereas Gemini 2.0 had the greatest variability. Deepseek v3 was most verbose (mean 533.8 words  51.6 sentences)  ChatGPT 4o the most concise (287 words  27.4 sentences)  and Gemini 2.0 the most inconsistent in length. No chatbot produced irrelevant content. Direct applicability in the Indian context was limited—to 2/5 ChatGPT 4o responses and 1/5 for each of the others. Reliability scores favored ChatGPT 4o (3.2)  followed by Gemini 2.0 (3.0) and Deepseek v3 (2.8).  Conclusion While all three AI chatbots demonstrated similar accuracy  significant gaps in completeness and regional applicability were evident.

Methods- A middle-aged man presented to a tertiary eye care hospital with a melanotic nodular mass on the lower eyelid  which was causing compression of the lacrimal punctum. Clinical evaluation raised suspicion of a neoplastic lesion  and the patient consented to surgical management. The procedure involved wide local excision with careful wound exploration to identify and preserve the lacrimal canaliculi and punctum. After securing these structures  the lesion was excised  creating a tissue defect that was closed with direct skin closure. In the postoperative period  mild anterior displacement of the punctum was observed. The patient has been kept under regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence  any residual lesion  or the development of epiphora  ensuring both oncologic safety and functional preservation. Conclusion- Lesions requiring wide local excision near the lacrimal drainage system demand meticulous surgical planning to preserve the canaliculi. Securing these structures intraoperatively is essential to prevent postoperative complications. Long-term follow-up is crucial to detect any recurrence  residual lesion  or the development of tear drainage issues such as epiphora., DOS Members, DD-2251, Dr. SHAILESH SINGH KANWAR, kanwarshailesh.kanwar8@gmail.com, 9873898206, AIIMS   New Delhi, DOS Members, AD-1753, DR.

Methods: Patients presenting with visual diminution and axial lengths >26.0 mm  diagnosed with visually significant cataracts  were included. All patients underwent phacoemulsification with IOL implantation. Preoperative ocular biometry was performed using a swept-source optical biometer (IOL Master 700). IOL power was calculated using SRK/T  Holladay 1  Holladay 2  and Barrett Universal II formulae. Predicted postoperative refractions were recorded. Refraction was assessed postoperatively at 1  3  and 6 weeks. The mean absolute error (MAE) i.e. the difference between predicted and actual postoperative refraction was calculated for each formula and compared. Results: The study included 46 eyes with a mean axial length of 27.60 mm. The mean postoperative refraction was 0.40 ± 0.62 D. The MAE for each formula was as follows: Barrett Universal II – 0.093 D  SRK/T – 0.29 D  Holladay 1 – 0.64 D  Holladay 2 – 0.59 D. A significant negative correlation between axial length and MAE was observed with SRK/T  Holladay 1  and Holladay 2  but not with Barrett Universal II. Conclusion: Barrett Universal II demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting postoperative refractive outcomes in high myopic eyes  with no significant correlation between axial length and prediction error.

A 30-year-old male presented with a history of workplace chemical splash injury to the face and eyes  followed by severe eye pain and inability to open the left eyelids. On examination  fragments of solidified chemical were observed over the face  hair  and eyebrows. A large solidified foreign body was lodged in the left eye  filling all fornices and tightly adhering to the eyelids and ocular surface. Associated findings included eyelid erythema and edema. NCCT Head revealed a hypodense foreign body anterior to the globe  conforming to its surface. Preoperative pharmacological testing using polyethylene glycol  corn oil  and water confirmed the chemical’s hydrophobic nature  ruling out chemical dissolution as a management option. The patient underwent foreign body removal under general anesthesia  during which the chemical mass was removed in toto (approximately 250 mm in diameter)  molded to the globe posteriorly. Post-removal evaluation revealed total limbal ischemia  complete epithelial loss  and stromal haze. After thorough saline lavage  amniotic membrane transplantation was performed. The patient was subsequently managed according to acute ocular chemical injury protocols using topical and systemic therapy.

Methods: This video demonstrates the management of a small pupil during cataract surgery using mechanical expansion with iris hooks and viscomydriaisis without mechanical dilatation. After achieving sufficient pupil dilation  a meticulously controlled capsulorhexis is performed  balancing size and stability to avoid extension. Phacoemulsification is carried out with low fluidics settings and controlled phaco power to reduce turbulence and minimize stress on the iris. Careful nuclear disassembly techniques are utilized to prevent mechanical trauma. Cortical cleanup is performed with gentle aspiration  maintaining capsular integrity and avoiding iris engagement. Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is executed under stable conditions with consideration for pupil behavior and capsule support. Throughout the procedure  intraoperative decision-making and adjustments are highlighted to ensure safety and efficacy.  Conclusion: Small pupils during phacoemulsification can be effectively managed using a combination of vsicomydriasis  mechanical expansion  careful surgical technique  and controlled intraocular dynamics. The stepwise approach demonstrated in this video emphasizes precision at each stage—from capsulorhexis to IOL implantation—reducing the risk of complications such as iris trauma  miosis  and postoperative inflammation. This technique offers a practical and reproducible strategy for cataract surgeons facing small pupil challenges in routine clinical practice.  , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 21:05:25]

Methods - This single-case report involved detailed clinical  radiological  and laboratory evaluation with a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management  A 21-year-old female with hypothyroidism for 7 months presented with a 1.5-year history of progressive  unilateral left eye proptosis  mild periocular pain  congestion  and gradual vision loss. Examination revealed firm retropulsion and optic disc pallor  with a normal anterior segment.  CEMRI orbit showed an ill-defined  hypointense heterogeneous soft tissue lesion involving both intraconal and extraconal compartments of the left orbit  with fat stranding. The lesion infiltrated the superior and lateral rectus muscles  with bulkiness of the inferior and medial rectus tendons. Initial differentials included thyroid eye disease (TED)  orbital pseudotumor  and IgG4-related disease. Elevated ESR and CRP supported an inflammatory etiology  but thyroid function tests  CBC  LFT  RFT  and serum IgG4 levels were normal. Autoimmune workup was negative for ANCA and rheumatoid factor.  Serology revealed triple positivity for lupus anticoagulant (LA)  anti-?2 glycoprotein I (a?2-GPI)  and anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies  confirming a diagnosis of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) with orbital involvement. The patient was initiated on systemic anticoagulation with heparin  with response under evaluation.  Conclusion: While ophthalmic involvement in APS typically includes vascular events like transient vision loss or occlusions  orbital inflammatory lesions are rare. Early recognition of such atypical presentations is essential  as timely anticoagulation can prevent further thrombotic complications. , DOS Members, AD-1753, DR.

Centre  All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi, , Interesting Cases, Ocular Oncology, Yolked and Misplaced: An Orbital Encounter With an Ovarian Tumor. , , Purpose: This report discusses a rare  malignant germ cell tumor in childhood that closely mimics more common orbital disorders  resulting in frequent diagnostic delays. Methods: A 19 months old girl presented to the emergency department with history of blunt trauma to right eye 1 month back followed by rapidly progressive proptosis in right eye since 15 days. Contrast- enhanced computed tomography (CECT) revealed a well defined heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue lesion in the right superotemporal orbit measuring 3.1*3.3*3.6 cm  with anteroinferior dystopia of right globe. Differential diagnoses of rhabdomyosarcoma  neuroblastoma were considered and an excision biopsy under general anaesthesia was planned. Histopathological examination confirmed presence of Schiller- Duval bodies  suggestive of endodermal sinus tumor (EST)  showing positivity for SALL4  PLAP  CK  GATA-3. Conclusion: EST or yolk sac tumor is a rare germ-cell neoplasm occurring primarily in the gonads. Extragonadal EST is exceedingly rare. It is clinically difficult to differentiate it from rhabdomyosarcoma  but should be considered in young children. Serum alfa fetoprotein (AFP) levels are typically elevated and tend to decrease following chemotherapy. Multimodal therapy with surgery  chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. , DOS Members, AD-1753, DR. SAHIL AGRAWAL, agrawalsahil03.acad@gmail.com, 7827309878, R.P.

Methods:?A 19-year-old female presented with a painless  progressive right eye mass at the medial caruncle  present for two years. She also reported multiple skin lesions on the right inguinal region  bilateral cubital fossae  and the upper lip over four years. Skin biopsy of the right arm revealed intradermal lesions composed of vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells  surrounded by lymphohistocytic infiltrates with eosinophils  consistent with ALHE. Ocular examination showed a 14 × 10 mm pinkish caruncular mass. MRI of the orbit revealed a 15 × 12 × 9 mm lesion at the right medial canthus with intermediate T1W  hyperintense FLAIR/STIR  and intermediate-to-hyperintense T2W signals  abutting the globe near the medial rectus insertion. The lesion showed subtle peripheral contrast enhancement. Treatment included an intralesional steroid injection (Triamcinolone acetate  0.3 ml)  resulting in an excellent response. Results:?The clinical  histopathological  and radiological findings confirmed ALHE. Significant regression of the ocular lesion was observed after treatment  with no recurrences noted during follow-up. Conclusions:?ALHE is a rare entity that can involve the orbit and adnexa. Differentiation from similar conditions  such as Kimura disease  is vital for optimal management. Intralesional steroids offer a promising  minimally invasive treatment for localized lesions  providing excellent outcomes. , DOS Members, P-453, DR.

Agarwal Trophy , Oculoplasty, Primary Orbital Liposarcoma: A Clinicopathologic Analysis of 8 Cases, , Purpose: To evaluate the clinical presentation  radiologic characteristics  and detailed histopathologic features of primary orbital liposarcoma through a retrospective case series.  Design: Retrospective observational case series. Methods:We retrospectively reviewed clinical records of 8 patients diagnosed with primary orbital liposarcoma. Data regarding demographic details  presenting symptoms  radiological findings  histopathology  and immunohistochemical (IHC) profiles were analyzed. Results: The most common presenting feature was painless  progressive abaxial proptosis associated with limitation of extraocular movements and gradual diminution of vision. The median age at presentation was 45 years (range: 38–58 years)  with duration of symptoms ranging from 1 to 5 years. Histopathological subtypes included myxoid (n=3)  pleomorphic (n=2)  and other variants (n=3). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for S-100 in 7 cases and vimentin in 5 cases. Two patients who initially underwent debulking surgery developed recurrence. All patients eventually underwent orbital exenteration  with one receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. No recurrence has been observed in any patient to date  with a median follow-up duration of 2 years. Conclusion: Primary orbital liposarcoma is an exceedingly rare malignant neoplasm typically presenting as painless proptosis with progressive visual decline. Due to its rarity  data on prognosis remains limited. Complete surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment  and long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence. , DOS Members, P-453, DR.

Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome is a rare  unilateral condition characterized by abnormal corneal endothelium leading to secondary angle-closure glaucoma. The coexistence of bilateral PACG with unilateral ICE syndrome presents diagnostic and management challenges.  Case Presentation: A 64-year-old male with a history of bilateral PACG  managed with peripheral iridotomy (PI) in both eyes and right eye trabeculectomy 18 years prior  presented with decreased vision. Best-corrected visual acuity was 3/60 in the right eye (RE) and 6/12 in the left eye (LE). Slit-lamp examination revealed nuclear sclerosis grade 2 with posterior subcapsular cataract in the RE. Fundus examination showed optic disc cupping of 0.9:1 in the RE and 0.7:1 in the LE. Gonioscopy demonstrated peripheral anterior synechiae in the RE. Specular microscopy revealed ICE cells with an endothelial cell count of 1200 cells/mm² in the RE and 2600 cells/mm² in the LE  confirming ICE syndrome in the RE.  Conclusion: This case highlights the importance of considering ICE syndrome in patients with unilateral angle-closure features  even in the presence of bilateral PACG.

Conclusion:  Additional posterior barrage laser photocoagulation appears to be a useful adjunct in selected cases of advanced stage 3 and early stage 4A ROP in zone 2 region. It can promote disease regression  reduce progression risk  and stabilize retinal traction when peripheral laser alone is insufficient., DOS Members, VD-2145, Dr. MADDU CH SAI VINEETH, SAIVINEETHMADDU@GMAIL.COM, 8978073383, Dr. R.P.

Methods In this retrospective comparative study  data of 50 eyes of EOPACG who fulfilled inclusion criteria and had underwent surgical intervention for IOP control were recruited. 25 of them had underwent Phaco-Goniotomy(Group 1) and 25 had underwent Trabeculectomy(Group 2). Their baseline data and postsurgical outcomes assessed at 1  3  6 and 12 months in terms of IOP control  need for IOP lowering  medications  post-operative complications  and need for a repeat surgical intervention were recorded.  Results  A significant IOP reduction was noted in both the groups  dropping from 40.08 ± 9.8 mmHg and 39.68  ± 7.52 mmHg to 14 ± 4.34 mmHg and 14.6 ± 3.18 mmHg with PG(Group 1) and trabeculectomy(Group 2)  respectively (p<0.001). A significant reduction in need for medications was also noted  reducing from 3 and 4 to 1 and 0 in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively (p<0.001). The postoperative IOP and medications needed at the end of 12 months was similar in both the groups (p=0.73 and p=0.94 respectively). 84 % eyes achieved success in Phacoemulsification with goniotomy group versus 72% in trabeculectomy group (p=0.76).The incidence of complications during 12 months follow up period was 12% and 24% for phacoemulsification with goniotomy versus trabeculectomy respectively (p=0.23).   Conclusion : Phaco-goniotomy was non-inferior to trabeculectomy in terms of IOP control and need for medications in patients with EOPACG. Trabeculectomy  however  showed a much higher incidence of complications., DOS Members, G-1251, DR.

Management often requires both medical and surgical interventions. Peripheral iridotomy (PI) is occasionally employed to relieve angle-closure components  particularly when posterior synechiae and iris bombe are present.  Case Presentation: A patient diagnosed with chronic uveitic glaucoma presented with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and iris bombe secondary to posterior synechiae. The patient underwent multiple peripheral laser iridotomies (five in total) to relieve pupillary block and restore aqueous flow. Slit-lamp examination revealed five well-defined iridotomies with patent openings  distributed across the peripheral iris. The cornea was clear with minimal anterior chamber reaction  and the iris demonstrated pigmentary changes consistent with chronic inflammation.  Conclusion: This case illustrates the use of multiple iridotomies as a management strategy for uveitic glaucoma with significant iris bombe. In refractory or recurrent cases  multiple PIs can be effective in preventing synechiae formation and controlling IOP  especially when conventional single-PI approaches fail., DOS Members, , Dr Kirti Singh, , , , Non Members, , Dr Arshi Singh, , , , Non Members, , Dr. Annu Joon, , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 23:13:17]

We report the case of a 60-year-old male presenting with a long-standing black nodular lesion on the left lower eyelid  which had recently ulcerated. Clinical suspicion initially pointed towards BCC  corroborated by an incisional biopsy showing nodular BCC without perineural or lymphovascular invasion. However  wide local excision and dacryocystectomy revealed moderately differentiated SCC with perineural invasion  raising diagnostic uncertainty. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the coexistence of two distinct malignancies: BCC and SCC  consistent with a collision tumour. This represents only the second such case reported worldwide.  CONCLUSION- The case highlights the importance of histopathological correlation  immunohistochemical analysis  and multidisciplinary collaboration in managing rare and diagnostically challenging eyelid malignancies. , Non Members, , VISHAL SHARMA, drsharmavishal@gmail.com, 7379091065, RIO SITAPUR, Non Members, , ZUBAIR, ZBR14BRD@GMAIL.COM, 9695301770, RIO SITAPUR, Non Members, , SABA BANO, SABABANO815@GMAIL.COM, 9140284408, RIO SITAPUR, Non Members, , ADITYA GAUTAM, adityagved98@gmail.com, 7510004772, RIO SITAPUR, 2025-04-18 23:14:37]

Anterior segment OCT showed “scrolling” of the anterior and posterior capsules . Unidirectional pull of the residual capsule by the remnant zonules caused it to scroll. The left pseudophakic eye had a dislocated bag-intraocular lens complex partially bridging the anterior and posterior segment . The intraocular lens within the capsular bag prevented capsular scroll in the left eye. he selective scrolling of only the anterior capsule in this patient was associated with absence of any hyaloid attachment  potentially similar to the selective rolling of the posterior flap of a giant retinal tear in the absence of vitreous adhesion and support.1 These findings suggest that absence of the scroll sign on the posterior capsule may warrant anterior vitrectomy with peripheral iridectomy before an anterior chamber intraocular lens is implanted to prevent pupillary block, Non Members, , Amber Bhayana, amber.amar.bhayana@gmail.com, 9871687940, All India Institue of medical sciences  New Delhi, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 23:18:08]

Methods: A 24 year old male presented with complaints of diminision of vision in left eye since 1 year following trauma to OS with hammer and chisel. BCVA was 6/6 in OD and hand movement in OS with accurate projection of rays. He underwent routine ophthalmological examination  along with USG B Scan  X-Ray  CT scan and fundus photography.  Results: OD anterior segment examination was within normal limits with normal fundus. OS had paracentral corneal opacity with pigments on endothelium  complicated total cataract and pigments on anterior lens capsule. IOP was within normal limits. Fundus was not visible. USG B Scan revealed a hyperechoeic shadow with 100% spike persisting on low gain suggestive of intraocular foreign body. X-ray showed a radio opaque foreign body in left orbit which was confirmed on CT as hyper dense intraocular opacity measuring 3*3 mm. The patient was planned for cataract surgery without IOL followed by fundus evaluation which confirmed a retained intraocular foreign body inferior to disc. Retina was attached throughout with minimal surrounding edema. He underwent Pars plans vitrectomy with IOFB removal with endolaser with IOL implantation in the second staged procedure.

However still  ophthalmologists may encounter a few early or long-term post-operative intraocular lens related complications. The paper highlights the surgical management of three different intraocular lens related complication with satisfactory outcome.  Purpose of the paper is to report the visual outcomes following intraocular lens (IOL) exchange in cases of opacified and decentred IOL  as well as IOL explanation in patients with Dead Bag Syndrome. METHOD- three consecutive cases of post-operative complications related to intraocular lenses (IOLs) were managed after thorough evaluation. One patient underwent IOL explanation for Dead Bag Syndrome  the second patient had IOL exchange due to intraocular lens opacification  and the third patient had IOL exchange for haptic fracture. The surgery was performed using an IOL cutter forceps  IOL grasper forceps  and modified IOL cutter Phaco tip   with   satisfactory post-operative visual outcomes. CONCLUSION- IOL exchange and explanation is a challenging  yet satisfactory treatment option. Meticulous planning and evaluation of post-operative IOL-related complications are important for the successful outcome. , DOS Members, P-265, Dr. OM PRAKASH, prakash_2196@yahoo.co.in, 9810689930, , DOS Members, C-8646, Dr. Harshvardhan Chilkoti, dr.harshvardhanchilkoti@gmail.com, 8295294544, , Non Members, , DR MUSHRIFA, mushrifaahmed98@gmail.com, 9933290784, LHMC  NEW DELHI, DOS Members, BD-2218, Dr. Kaveri Birla, drkaveribirla@gmail.com, 9711125428, , 2025-04-18 23:21:32]

Synopsis: A 30-year-old male presented with the chief complaint of diminution of vision and floaters in the left eye (LE) for one month. Upon examination  his visual acuities (VA) were recorded as 6/6 in the right eye (RE) and FCCF with PR accurate in LE. The LE exhibited neovascularization of the iris (NVI) along with a yellowish mass lesion in the fundus region located superotemporally accompanied by a single dilated and tortuous vessel. Furthermore  disc swelling and multiple small white spherical lesions within the vitreous were observed. No abnormalities were observed in RE. Ocular USG of LE revealed a heterogeneous dome-shaped intra-ocular mass displaying moderate surface reflectivity and mild internal echoes. Subsequently  CE-MRI scan of the orbits and brain displayed a nodular lesion in LE  exhibiting isointensity on T1w imaging and hypointensity on T2w imaging  with heterogeneous post-contrast enhancement  measuring 5x8x8mm. A preliminary diagnosis of "LE Adult Onset Group D RB with active vitreous seeds" was made  and intravenous chemotherapy (IVC) was started. Post completion of 6 cycles of IVC (SD-VEC regimen)  the patients VA in LE improved to 6/12 and NVI also resolved. Additionally  a significant reduction in tumour size was observed  although few vitreous seeds persisted necessitating the administration of Intravitreal Topotecan in LE. Subsequent follow-up examinations indicated the disappearance of vitreous seeds  however  a small active tumour mass was still present for which Plaque brachytherapy with Ru-106 was done in LE. Subsequent evaluations revealed regression of the tumour. Conclusions: Although adult-onset RB is a rare occurrence  this particular case underscores the importance of considering RB as a potential differential diagnosis in adults presenting with a mass lesion in the fundus.

Presentation: The patient presented with painless  progressive diminution of vision in the left eye since a few years and had previously consulted another ophthalmologist 10 days prior for similar symptoms. The recorded fundus fundings were diffuse pigmentary changes and subretinal edema  predominantly in the left eye. Laboratory tests including CBC with ESR  Chest X-Ray  Mantoux test  ANA  RA factor  and serum ACE levels were done. She was initially diagnosed with choroiditis and started on anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) following a positive Mantoux test.  Upon evaluation  visual acuity was recorded as 6/9 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Posterior segment examination showed a large hypopigmented yellowish patch on the macula of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed hyperreflective material deposition with subretinal fluid. A diagnosis of Best Vitelliform Dystrophy was confirmed via electro-oculography (EOG). The Mantoux test was repeated and returned negative  leading to the discontinuation of ATT after consultation with a physician.  Conclusion: This case highlights the diagnostic challenge posed by Best Vitelliform Dystrophy  initially misdiagnosed as choroiditis  underscoring the importance of comprehensive re-evaluation in patients with atypical presentations of common ocular diseases.  , DOS Members, C-5558, DR.

He reported intermittent blurring of vision and a foreign body sensation. Clinical examination revealed sectoral conjunctival congestion with a limbal nodular lesion and associated corneal epithelial irregularity. The lesion was elevated  with adjacent stromal haze and superficial vascularization  raising suspicion for ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). However  closer slit-lamp examination revealed fine keratic precipitates  mild anterior chamber reaction  and subtle iris transillumination defects. There was no significant leukoplakia or feeder vessels typically associated with OSSN.  Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) revealed hyperreflective epithelial thickening  but lacked the abrupt transition and epithelial disorganization characteristic of OSSN. Corneal sensation was markedly reduced. A diagnosis of herpetic keratouveitis mimicking OSSN was made. The patient was initiated on oral acyclovir and topical corticosteroids with dramatic resolution of the lesion and inflammation over two weeks.  This case underscores the protean manifestations of HSV keratitis  particularly in elderly individuals  where chronic or recurrent inflammation may induce pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia  mimicking neoplastic processes. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgical intervention or inappropriate therapy. Awareness of atypical presentations and judicious use of diagnostic modalities such as AS-OCT and PCR can aid in distinguishing HSV keratouveitis from OSSN and other masqueraders., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 23:40:26]

Synopsis:  26-year-old male presented with painless progressive vision loss in left eye. On examination  his visual acuities were 6/6 in the right eye and HMCF with PR accurate in the left eye. LE had congestion with 1+ cells in the anterior chamber with posterior synechia at 4 and 8 o’clock. A dilated fundus examination of the left eye revealed a large superior intra-ocular mass with surrounding exudative retinal detachment We clinically suspected this to be a choroidal melanoma. MRI orbit with contrast showed a T1 hyperintense lesion with subretinal bleed with no enhancement on post-contrast films. The PET scan revealed no abnormal focal metabolically active lesion in the posterior chamber of the left eyeball with no evidence of any significant metabolically active lesion anywhere else in the body Because of inconclusive MRI findings  we performed the CECT orbit which revealed diffusely increased left intraocular density compared with the right globe and no obvious enhancing lesion in the left globe with the final impression being Retinal detachment with subretinal bleed and ? intraretinal macrocyst. The patient then underwent left eye FNAC and cytospin smears from left eye intraretinal cyst were all acellular. The patient is currently under regular  clinic surveillance with no change in the size of intra-retinal cyst at 3 months follow-up.  Conclusions:The presence of the intraretinal cyst in this patient showcases the diverse differential diagnoses that clinicians must consider when evaluating intra-ocular mass. Despite its diagnostic challenges  a step-wise approach will help distinguish masquerades from actual uveal melanoma and help direct appropriate treatment., DOS Members, LD-1810, DR.

Optic neuritis has also never been reported with MCTD. We describe a rare case of a patient with unilateral occlusive retinal vasculitis and bilateral optic neuritis associated with MCTD. Case- A 35 years old lady came with bilateral optic neuritis with no perception of light in both the eyes  was treated with IV methylprednisolone as per ONTT  regained vision.Her BCVA was RE 6/6 and LE 6/9 A month later  presented with sudden vision loss in the right eye  was diagnosed with occlusive vasculitis based on multiple CNP areas on FFA. She underwent prophylactic laser photocoagulation for the same.Meanwhile she developed livedo reticularis along with photosensitive rash and was diagnosed with Mixed Connective Tissue Disorder after testing positive for U1- RNP Ab. She was treated with immunosupressants which included Hydroxychloroquine along with Corticosteroids which sent her in remission.About 4 months later  she presented to us with decreased  vision in the right eye and a pale optic disc and BCVA of FCCF with Accurate projection of rays and 6/24 in the left eye. Conclusion- MCTD can be associated with retinal vasculitis and optic neuritis  which in our case responded to systemic immunosuppressive therapy  but became active again owing to the autoimmune nature of the systemic disease. , Non Members, , Prof P K Sahu , pksahu@ucms.ac.in, 9625900779, university college of medical sciences , Non Members, , Dr Nitika Beri , berinitika@gmail.com, 9871130760, university college of medical sciences , Non Members, , Dr Niharika Batra , niharikabatra96@gmail.com, 9650088992, university college of medical sciences , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 23:48:29]

Here we present a case where a 1 year-male of presumed retinoblastoma with unusual clinical presentation was referred to our centre on February 2025. Clinical signs  symptoms  visual acuity  anterior segment findings  fundus photography (Retcam 3)  ultrasonography (B/A)  MR brain orbit imaging (CEMRI) were noted. There was bilateral corneal opacity & microphthalmia and no perceivable vision in either eye with no response in visually evoked potential. RE imaging showed an ill-defined mass not very typical of retinoblastoma with scant calcific foci & few mid vitreous opacities whereas LE showed a stalk like projection attached to optic disc. A next generation genome sequencing for RB1 gene was done & showed an autosomal dominant pathogenic mutation with exon 4-21 deletion on chr 13g. A diagnosis of RE retinoblastoma was made & enucleation was performed. Histopathology showed morphological characteristics of coat’s disease with no evidence of anaplastic cells., DOS Members, C-2598, Dr. BHAVNA CHAWLA, bhavna2424@hotmail.com, 9654842424, All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi, DOS Members, LD-1810, DR.

Toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) offer a precise and effective solution for preexisting corneal astigmatism  provided accurate preoperative planning and meticulous intraoperative execution. This video demonstrates the step-by-step implantation of a toric IOL in a patient with visually significant cataract and regular corneal astigmatism.  Key surgical pearls are highlighted  including the importance of accurate biometry  axis marking techniques (manual and digital)  and intraoperative alignment. Intraoperative aberrometry is shown to enhance precision in select cases. The video emphasizes the need for thorough viscoelastic removal to prevent postoperative rotation  and showcases rotational stability assessment at the conclusion of the case.  Postoperative outcomes demonstrated excellent refractive correction with the toric IOL remaining well-aligned at follow-up. Challenges such as intraoperative cyclotorsion  posterior capsular opacification  and rotational misalignment are briefly discussed with management strategies.  This video underscores that with proper patient selection  meticulous planning  and surgical precision  toric IOL implantation is a highly effective method for managing corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery  leading to enhanced patient satisfaction and improved visual quality.  , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-18 23:58:36]

However  in rare cases  the occlusion can involve the nasal and temporal halves of the retina  presenting a unique diagnostic and clinical challenge.  PURPOSE: To report an unusual case of temporal hemiretinal vein occlusion in a hypertensive patient and discuss its clinical presentation and management  A 77 year old hypertensive male presented with sudden  painless diminution of vision in right eye since one month. On examination  the anterior segment revealed no abnormalities. On fundoscopy  retinal haemorrhages involving the temporal retina in between the superior and inferior vascular arcade alongwith macular edema  dilated and tortuous retinal veins  arteriovenous crossing changes and disc collaterals were noticed. OCT showed cystoid macular edema with central macular thickness of 689?m. No neovascularization was revealed on fluorescein fundus angiography and gonioscopy. Left eye evalution was unremarkable. Carotid Artery doppler showed relatively more increased intimo- medial thickness on right side as compared to left side. Blood investigations were within normal limits. The patient was given intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and is on regular follow up.  CONCLUSION: We present a case of a temporal HRVO  deviating from the more common vertical hemispheric presentation. In this case  venous drainage of the retina corresponds to nasal and temporal hemispheres  reflecting an anomalous vascular development of the retina. This case highlights the importance of careful fundoscopic and imaging assessment and emphasizes the need to consider anatomical and vascular variations in retinal pathology. , DOS Members, R-5590, DR.

We report one such type of presentation in a 3 month old infant who presented to our clinic with severe bilateral proptosis  inferior conjunctival chemo sis and corneal haze suggestive of Exposure Keratopathy. The rest of the anterior segment examination was within normal limits. The fundus examination revealed normal findings which were seen hazily due to corneal haze.  The parents of the child had a history of consanguinity and this was their first child.  They were advised genomic evaluation and MRI Brain with Orbit along with a neurosurgery opinion. Bilateral eyelid taping along with profuse lubrication was prescribed as symptomatic management. , Non Members, , Dr. Shipra Sharda , shipra.sharda01@gmail.com, 96438 00843, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalay , Non Members, , Dr. Priyanka Prasad , priyanka.prasad@gmail.com, 90136 32915, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitasalay , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-19 04:43:57]

Method: A narrative review was conducted analyzing recent literature and clinical findings related to Demodex blepharitis. Focus was placed on its pathophysiology  diagnostic signs  and treatment strategies. Particular attention was given to hallmark features such as cylindrical dandruff at the base of lashes  lid margin inflammation  and meibomian gland dysfunction. Diagnostic methods including slit-lamp examination and lash sampling for microscopic evaluation were reviewed. Management strategies such as tea tree oil-based lid hygiene  ivermectin  and other emerging therapies were evaluated for efficacy  tolerability  and long-term outcomes.  Conclusion: Demodex blepharitis remains underdiagnosed despite its high prevalence  especially in patients with recalcitrant blepharitis and dry eye symptoms. The presence of cylindrical dandruff should prompt clinicians to consider Demodex infestation as a differential. Early identification and implementation of targeted lid hygiene regimens can significantly improve symptoms and reduce chronic ocular surface inflammation. Educating both clinicians and patients about this often-missed etiology can lead to improved diagnostic rates and therapeutic outcomes. Greater awareness and standardized diagnostic approaches are crucial in preventing prolonged morbidity in affected individuals., Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-19 06:10:54]

Agarwal Trophy , Glaucoma, Effects of steep Trendelenburg position during Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic procedures on Intra Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Head parameters  , , Purpose - To assess the extent of variation in IOP and other systemic parameters in patients undergoing RALP in steep Trendelenburg position and to evaluate its effects on visual functions.   Materials & Methods- 49 patients who underwent RALP (mostly prostrate surgery) at a tertiary hospital in North India were enrolled. After recording IOPby GAT  a detailed base-line pre-operative assessment of ONH including visual field analysis (VFA)  OCT RNFL  and fundus photography was done. Intra-operative recording of IOPalong with BP HR and EtCO2 was done at 5 different timelines (T1-T5 representing different intra-operative positions) and then followed after 1 month.   Results - Rise in IOP from baseline (T1) was significant at all dependent head positions  with peak rise of 12.45 ± 3.34 mm Hg noted at T4 (steep Trendelenburg position 30 minutes prior to restoring supine position}. There was a marginal improvement in VF indices like mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) (p<0.001). The average RNFL thickness showed decrease in both eyes (p<0.001). Optic disc assessment showed no significant progression after one month.  Conclusion-RALP leads to significant and sustained rise in IOPin Trendelenburg position  returning to near base-line after resuming supine position in half an hour. Patients with healthy ONH were found to withstand these variations without any significant worsening of the parameters. Exclusion of patients with pre-existing ocular morbidities like glaucoma would be warranted to avoid any further compromise. , DOS Members, A-4926, Dr. RINKY ANAND, dr.rinky11@gmail.com, 8447615053, Max Healthcare, Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , Non Members, , , , , , 2025-04-19 08:54:53]

Dry eye is one of the most frequent complications of refractive surgery  affecting up to 60% of patients during the early postoperative period. Development of refractive surgery dry eye is caused by surgical transection and laser ablation of corneal sensory nerve fibers  resulting in decreased corneal sensitivity and interruption of the corneal–neural–lacrimal reflex arc that controls tear production and the blink rate. Current stress on postoperative treatment of dry eyes is on liberating agents  tears substitutes and anti-inflammatory agents like steroids and cyclosporine eye drops. Inflammation caused by the surgery  the distortion of the ocular surface and preservative in the eye drops used post-operatively  all exacerbate the condition. Lactoferrin  a glycoprotein present in the tears  has several functions  including anti-inflammatory  antimicrobial and as well as promotion of cell growth. Oral lactoferrin has been used as a treatment in Sjogren’s and non-Sjogren dry eyes with good results., DOS Members, S-317, Dr. NAMRATA SHARMA, namrata.sharma@gmail.com, 9810856988, , Non Members, , Dr. C Shakkarwal, , , , DOS Members, , , , , , DOS Members, , , , , , 2025-04-21 13:47:25]
